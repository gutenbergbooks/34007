<p><a name="SEC_1_1_FLAG" id="SEC_1_1_FLAG"></a>The Postage Stamp follows the Flag. The same small
talisman which passes our letters across the seven
seas to friends the world over maintains the lines
of personal communication with our soldiers and sailors in time
of war. Wherever the British Tommy goes he must have his
letters from home; like the lines of communication, which are
the life-line of the army, postal communication is the chief
support of the courage and spirit of the individual soldier. His
folk at home send him new vigour with every letter that tells
of the persons, places and things that are nearest and most
cherished in his memory.</p>

<p>In these days letter-sending and letter-getting are so common-place
that few give any thought to the great organisation by
which thousands of millions of postal packets are posted and
delivered in this country every year. And now that most
of us have friends at the Front, in France, in Belgium, or on
the high seas, we are perhaps inclined to take it all just as a
matter of course that letters pass and repass much in the
ordinary humdrum way. This is plain to the conductors of our
postal services when during war time they get numerous complaints
from individuals of delay or even non-delivery, or any
one of a number of other minor inconveniences which must
often be unavoidable in the stirring times of war.</p>

<p>To-day many thousands of letters and postal packets are
being sent to and received from the troops of the British
Expeditionary Force in France, yet it is a simple fact that<!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but a small percentage of the civilian population in this country
knows anything of the existence, far less of the workings,
of the Army Postal Service as an organisation separate and
distinct from the postal department of the home Government.
The Army Postal Service is administered under a Director
of Postal Services, who is responsible to the Commander in
Chief of the Army, and whose system is established with the
co-operation of the Inspector-General of Communications.</p>

<p>The formation of a British Army Post Office Corps is of
comparatively recent date. It was first suggested by Colonel
du Plat Taylor in the seventies, as a means of using the
services of the Post Office Rifle Volunteers in war time, but
it was not until the Egyptian campaign in 1882 that the corps
was formed.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_2_CRIMEA" id="SEC_1_2_CRIMEA"></a>Prior to this, however, bodies of servants of the Post Office
had done duty with the army in organising and maintaining
postal communication with the armies in the field and with
the links connecting up with the home service. During the
Crimean War extensive arrangements were made by the Post
Office to maintain postal communication with the forces in
Turkey, the Black Sea, and the Baltic. Prior to the war,
the British Government did not maintain any postal packets
between Mediterranean ports save some steam vessels for
the transport of the Indian mails, and some of these were
taken up by the military and naval authorities. Letters for
Constantinople and the Levant ordinarily went through the
French and Austrian administrations and were chargeable at
the then high foreign rates of postage. With the assistance
of the French Government, letters were sent <i>vi&acirc;</i> Marseilles to
Constantinople (or <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>) at first at intervals of three times
a month, but afterwards six times a month, and during the
latter period of the war, twice a week.</p>

<p>But the French mail packets went no further than Constantinople,
so the British Postmaster-General sent out an
experienced officer, Mr. E. J. Smith, of the London General
Post Office, to Turkey as Postmaster of His Majesty's Forces;
and three Assistant Postmasters, together with seven Letter
Sorters. As the facilities for land transport accorded the
Postmaster proved insufficient he was furnished with eighteen
horses and mules for the exclusive use of his office. The
Postmaster was supplied with the postage stamps of the home
country, then (so far as the penny and twopence denominations<!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
were concerned) in the early and beautifully engraved design
of William Wyon's "Queen's Head." This was the first
use of British postage stamps on foreign territory, or indeed
anywhere beyond the limits of the British Isles, and stamp
collectors take a considerable interest in the English stamps
which survive with the various Crimean postmarks specially
supplied to the Postmaster of His Majesty's Forces in the East.
Stamps used on letters from the forces may be recognised by
either the Crown and Stars or Cypher and Stars or the circular
dated postmarks (<i>Figs.</i> 1-4). A range of the early penny
red stamps, from the imperforate red-brown stamp of 1841 to
the Die II. large Crown perforated 14 stamp may be found,
as well as the twopence blues of the same period, and the
4d. rose (1857), 6d. violet (1854), and 1s. green (1847) (<a href="#FIG_5_6_7"><i>see
Figs. 5-10</i></a>). There are possibly others not yet known to
collectors.</p>

<p>The correspondence dealt with by this small staff was considerable,
averaging 45,250 letters despatched to and 43,125
received from the seat of war in each month. In one year
543,000 letters were despatched to and 517,500 received from
the forces in the Crimea.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_3_ABOLITION" id="SEC_1_3_ABOLITION"></a>The chief officer in charge at the British post offices in
Turkey and the Crimea during the war, Mr. E. J. Smith, is
specially mentioned in the Postmaster-General's report for 1857
as having discharged his duties in a very creditable manner.
In that year his services were offered to and accepted by the
Turkish Government with a view to establishing an improved
postal service in the Sultan's dominions. Since this date British
post offices have been maintained (in common with post offices of
other Powers) in various parts of the Turkish dominions, using
British stamps with or without a special overprint. These offices
were closed in October, 1914, as a result of Turkey's declaration
of the "abolition of the Capitulations," just prior to Turkey's
open acts of war against the allied forces of Great Britain,
France, and Russia in the present war.</p>

<p>Ordinary British stamps used at the British post-offices in
the Ottoman Empire may be distinguished by postmarks
(<i>Figs.</i> 11-17).</p>

ordinary date stamps of all these places.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_4_BALTIC" id="SEC_1_4_BALTIC"></a>Special arrangements were also made
for maintaining postal communications
with the British Fleet in the Baltic, the
stamps used being distinguishable by
postmarks of diamond-shaped internal
configuration (<i>Fig.</i> 20). It is possible
that date marks of Dantzig may also be found on
British stamps of this period; they appear on the covers of
letters bearing British stamps with the diamond cancellations.
In the early part of the naval campaign letters were transmitted<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
exclusively by war vessels or transports, but in the beginning of
May, 1854, when the greater part of the Fleet had reached its
destination the Admiral commanding in chief was directed to
establish regular weekly communication by steamer between the
ships under his command and the port of Dantzig. Mails for
the Fleet were despatched from London every Tuesday to
Dantzig, under cover of a bag addressed to Her Britannic
Majesty's Consul at that port, who handed the bag over to the
commander of the steamer which was timed to arrive at Dantzig
each Friday. This arrangement, while satisfactory in respect
of speed and regularity, involved the charging of the high
foreign rates of postage, as the route was through Belgium and
Prussia, but, as often as facilities offered, mails were made up
for transmission by Government transports passing to and from
England and the Baltic, by which soldiers and sailors were able
to send and receive letters at their privilege rate of one penny
each.</p>

authorised on July 18, 1882, for service in Egypt, and it was
promptly completed. Colonel du Plat Taylor was instructed
to form the corps of two officers and one hundred men from the
Post-Office Volunteers (24th Middlesex) for enrolment in the
first-class Army Reserve. The men combined the advantages
of experience in postal work, as sorters and postmen, with army
training. The officers selected were Major Sturgeon (of the
Money Order Office) and Captain Viall (Receiver and Accountant
General's Department), the former taking command with
the army rank of Captain, and the latter seconding him, with
the army rank of Lieutenant. The men received their post-office
pay, and, while on active service, in addition to free kit
and rations, the privates drew army pay of 1s., corporals 1s. 8d.,
and sergeants 2s. 4d. per day.</p>

<p>The famous blind Postmaster-General, Henry Fawcett, inspected
the corps at the General Post Office on July 26, and
the officers with 50 men sailed on August 8, disembarking
at Alexandria on August 21. Their first postal duties were
undertaken at Alexandria and Ramleh, but two days after
disembarkation they re-embarked, joining up with Lord
Wolseley's main forces at Ismailia on August 26. The base
was at Ismailia, whence the post
office corps sent out its branches,
planting advanced base and field
post offices connecting the base
with the changing front, between
which and the base a daily service
was maintained. In September,
shortly after the battle of Tel-el-Kebir,
the Army and the Army
Post Office reached Cairo, and re-embarked
for home on October 7.
The despatches gave high praise
to the efficiency and useful service of the corps.<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Three years later, Major Sturgeon (promoted in recognition
of his services in Egypt, 1882) again commanded a corps of
twenty N.C.O.'s and men, in Sir Gerald Graham's Suakim
expedition of 1885. The corps left England on March 3,
and returned on July 28, after a more difficult experience with
the Suakim garrison than they had met with in the first Egyptian
campaign.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_9_SOUTH_AFRICA" id="SEC_1_9_SOUTH_AFRICA"></a><span class="smcap">South Africa, 1899-1902.</span> Major Sturgeon was succeeded
in the command of the Army Postal Corps by his second in
command, Captain Viall. On the death of the latter (1890),
Captain G. W. Treble of the London Postal Service took the
command, which he held at the outbreak of the South African
War in 1899, aided by Captain W. Price (now Colonel W.
Price, C.M.G., in command of the Army Post Office with
the British Expeditionary Force in France) and Lieutenant H.
M'Clintock, these latter officers belonging to the Secretary's
Office of the G.P.O., London. A first portion of the company,
with Captain Treble, left England with General Buller and
his staff, and the rest followed on October 21, and several<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
further detachments went out with later contingents. In South
Africa they had a very wide area to cover. At the outset
Captain Treble established himself with the headquarters of
the Inspector General of Communications in Cape Colony, and
moved about keeping close touch with the movements of the
forces, an important part of his duties being to forward to
the various offices the information necessary to ensure the correct
circulation of the mails. Captain Price was at Cape Town,
and Lieutenant M'Clintock at Pietermaritzburg.</p>

<p>The British military mails were made up in the London
G.P.O. in special bags addressed to the Army Post Office,
and sent to the G.P.O. at Cape Town, in which building the
detachment of the Army Postal Corps under Captain Price
had established its base office. The bags containing military
mails were handed over to the Army Base Post Office at Cape
Town whence they were distributed to the various military
post offices established at the centres of the troops, and to
field post offices with each Brigade or Division in the field.
In the return direction the soldiers' letters were handed in at
field post offices and forwarded through various channels, sometimes
ordinary and ofttimes military to the base at Cape Town,
whence they were despatched to England in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Early in 1900 the average weekly mail from London to the
Field Forces was 150 bags of letters, postcards, etc., and
60 boxes of parcels; the incoming mail from the Field Forces
was 11 bags of letters per week. In a letter dated from Cape
Town, February 27, from Lieutenant Preece, who went out
with reinforcements for the Army Post Office Corps in February,
are some interesting glimpses of the difficulties of the work
of this service<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Price, of the Post Office Corps, met us and told us (Captain)
Palmer was to leave at once for Kimberley with 17 men (Captain)
Labouchere and (Lieut.) Curtis to proceed on to Natal with 50 men,
and I was to take the remainder ashore here (Cape Town) and stop
to help at the base. At 9.30 on Monday morning I marched off
with my 57 men to the main barracks and bid good-bye to the
good ship 'Canada' and her merry cargo. After lodging the men
in barracks I went off to the G.P.O., where I found Price and his
40 men ensconced in one huge wing, overwhelmed with work, and
at breaking-down point. The mails every week increase now, and
we have 250,000 pieces of mail matter to sort and distribute every
week, over a country larger than France, among a shifting population
of soldiers, each of whom expects to get his letters as easily as he
gets his rations. It is a vast job, and we have done wonderfully<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
so far with a totally inadequate staff. We have come in the nick
of time. The recent movements (the advance of Lord Roberts from
Modder River, relief of Ladysmith, etc.) have caused chaos among
our mails. We receive and send telegrams every hour either to a
field post office or to headquarter staffs. The latter order immediate
reinforcement at Modder River, and Price has decided to send me
up with more men to proceed to Paardeberg, or wherever the troops
are, to get things straight."</p></div>

<p>The preliminary arrangements necessitated by the vast area
of the operations provided for two base offices, the one in Cape
Colony and the other in Natal, and 43 field post offices, and
by June, 1900, the Army Postal Corps was composed of ten
officers and 400 N.C.O.'s and men, exclusive of post office
telegraphists, etc., serving with the Royal Engineers. Many
interesting statistics of the mails at different periods of the war
have been given in various records, but it will suffice to quote
some general ones on the authority of the Postmaster-General.
His forty-sixth report, 1900, states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>During eight months of the Crimean War, 362,000 letters were
sent out, and 345,000 were sent home. During a similar period of
the war in South Africa 5,629,938 letters were sent out, and
2,731,559 were sent home.</p></div>

<p>The work of the corps was not undisturbed by the depredations
of the enemy, and not infrequently the members of the
corps had to defend the mails in their charge along with the
guards provided by the military. On June 7, 1900, General
De Wet, who has lately extinguished the admiration in which
Britons held him for his brilliant and elusive tactics, by his
treachery in the present war, swooped down with 1200 men
and 5 guns on Roodewal Station where Lieutenant Preece had
2000 bags, a several weeks' accumulation of mails for Lord
Roberts' main army. There were 17 men of the Army Postal
Corps, and these, with about 160 men in charge of supplies,
etc., had to defend the station. Two of the seventeen were
killed, and Lieutenant Preece and the remainder of his gallant
little corps were taken prisoners. The 2000 mail bags were
used as a barricade. It is recorded that when the gallant little
band surrendered, and De Wet, riding an English cavalry horse,
came up, the Boer general was most polite and even kind in
many ways, and expressed himself as "very sorry to do it,"
when asked not to destroy the letters and registered parcels.
He said if he did not do so, his young Boers would open and
read them and turn the letters of the soldiers into ridicule. The
bags were opened, the contents strewed about, and the Boers<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
possessed themselves of the valuables, while tobacco, cigarettes,
cakes, chocolates were so plentifully strewed about that the
young Boers even invited their prisoners to help themselves, as
the General was going to burn everything. And he did burn
the entire station.</p>

<p>In his forty-seventh report (1901) the Postmaster-General
states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Army Post Office is still in operation in South Africa. The
staff now consists of 7 officers and about 540 men. The weekly mail
for the Army Post Office contains on an average 204,000 letters
and 115,300 packets of printed matter; and it is estimated that
during the year ended 31st March, 1901, 11,551,300 letters were
sent to the troops and 9,250,000 were received from them. During
the same period the parcels sent out to the forces in South Africa
by post amounted to 534,245, the largest number despatched on any
one occasion, namely, on the 1st of December, 1900, being 19,672.
About 8745 such parcels are now sent each week.</p>

<p>As to the magnitude and difficulties of the work of the Army Post
Office, I cannot do better than quote the following paragraph from
Earl Roberts' despatch of the 16th August last:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The magnitude of the task set the Military Postal Service may be
appreciated when it is realised that the Army Mails from England
have exceeded in bulk the whole of the mails arriving for the
inhabitants of Cape Colony and Natal, and contained each week
little short of 750,000 letters, newspapers, and parcels for the troops.
No little credit is therefore due to the department under Major
Treble in the first few months, and for the greater part of the time
under Lieut.-Colonel J. Greer, Director of Military Postal Services,
for the way in which it has endeavoured to cope with the vast
quantity of correspondence, bearing in mind the incessant manner in
which the troops have been moved about the country, the transport
difficulties which had to be encountered, the want of postal experience
in the bulk of the personnel of the corps, and the inadequacy
of the establishments laid down for the several organisations."</p>

<p>His Majesty has been pleased to confer the honour of C.M.G. on
Messrs. Greer and Treble in acknowledgment of their services.</p></div>

<p>The forty-eighth report (1902) mentions no change of any
importance in the Army Postal Service in South Africa, and
gives the weekly average mail from England as 184,000 letters
and 143,600 packets of printed matter: the total number of
letters for the year ended March 31, 1902, was 10,774,000
outward, and 8,372,000 homeward, showing a decrease compared
with previous returns. During the same period 528,000
parcels were sent out.</p>

<p>The last official reference to the Army Postal Service in
South Africa is contained in the forty-ninth (1903) report,
announcing its withdrawal, postal communications with the
troops still on service in the old colonies and the new ones
being carried on through the Colonial Post Offices under the
ordinary regulations. The Peace was declared May 31, 1902.<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The war in South Africa left its impress on many pages of
the stamp collector's album, but at this juncture we are chiefly
concerned with the immediate work of the British military
postal service. Collectors have followed the use of the stamps
of the home country into the distant fields of operations by means
of the various postmarks which are summarised as follows from

to say that the volume of correspondence now being dealt with

Army. In the early months of the war the outgoing mail to

<p><a name="SEC_1_11_ADDRESSING" id="SEC_1_11_ADDRESSING"></a>It may be well to give a brief outline of the methods of the
Army Postal Service, that its work may be better known and
understood. In addressing letters to the troops it is important
to give the full military particulars of the addressee, <i>viz</i>:&mdash;Regimental
number, rank, name, squadron, battery or company,
battalion, regiment (or other unit), staff appointment or department,
and title of the Expeditionary Force. With these details
set out clearly on the envelope, the work of the Army Postal
Service is facilitated and the letter stands every chance of going
through without delay.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_12_FRANCE_MARKS" id="SEC_1_12_FRANCE_MARKS"></a>In France, as the postmarks already illustrated denote, the
British Army Postal Service has several grades of post offices.
The chief is the Base Post Office, the principal sorting establishment
for all mail matter passing between our British Post
Office and the Army Postal Service. The Base Office is quite
a large concern and has a vast amount of clerical work to
perform. In it letters are sorted, letters taking precedence over
all other mail matter, after which the newspapers, and lastly
the parcels are dealt with. Accounts of all the branch post
offices are filed and the general routines and formulae of the
Post Office at home are adhered to in detail. Letters, etc.,
for services, departments and units at the base are put into<!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
callers' boxes for delivery to the post orderlies. Those for
more distant services and units are forwarded to the various
grades of branch offices.</p>

<p>At the Base Office one of the most complicated and difficult
tasks is the re-direction of letters. Here are kept hospital lists,
giving names of men away from their units in hospital, and these
hospital rolls are revised weekly. Here also records have to
be kept of the movements of the units, and these records are
constantly in process of revision, and frequent communication
is maintained with every branch office in the field.</p>

<p>From the Base Office mails for field units are forwarded to
the Advanced Base Post Office, which in its turn distributes
them to the Field Post Offices serving the units to which the
letters are addressed. There are several kinds of field post
offices; those "with train" are attached to the headquarters
of each train, and handle the letters of the units served by the
train. Branch field post offices are attached to the general
headquarters, and to the headquarters of armies, divisions, and
brigades. Then there are stationary field post offices at various
points on the line of communication, and in some cases travelling
post offices on railway lines.</p>

<p>It devolves upon the Director of Army Postal Services, who
is represented at general headquarters, and at the headquarters
of each Army by an Assistant Director, to organise the service,
and to supply to the various offices the information necessary to
ensure the proper circulation of the mails. This, especially
in a campaign like the present, is a delicate task, often complicated
by the restrictions necessary in military policy to preserve
secrecy as to the movements of the troops.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_1_13_NAVAL" id="SEC_1_13_NAVAL"></a><span class="smcap">Naval Postmarks</span>. Of the naval postal arrangements,
reference has already been made to the cancellations used on
letters originating with the British Fleet in the Baltic during the
Crimean War (<a href="#FIG_20"><i>Fig.</i> 20</a>). Special navy post offices were in
the early days established by
local postmasters at various
ports as a link between the land
service and the Fleet in home
waters. The letters were marked
with <i>Fig.</i> 44, and the local postmaster collected an extra penny
charge upon such letters for delivery to ships lying in the
harbour or roadstead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">

</div><p><!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The late Mr. W. G. Hendy, of the Muniment Room,
records that with the introduction of Uniform Penny Postage
(1840) it was decided so far as Portsmouth was concerned, that
such letters should be delivered free in the harbour as far as
Spithead; but it was not until May, 1852, that the practice of
charging the extra penny for delivery was abolished at Devonport
and Plymouth, and free delivery extended to all vessels
lying in the harbour (Hamoaze), although not to vessels lying
in Plymouth Sound. The following are types of postmarks used
after free delivery was granted. (<i>Figs.</i> 45, 46.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<p>The same authority states that a privilege was accorded to
non-commissioned officers, seamen, and soldiers of sending and
receiving within any part of the British dominions, under certain
regulations, letters on their own concerns only, not exceeding
half an ounce, at the rate of one penny each. Such letters had
to be superscribed with the name of the seaman or soldier, his
class and description, the name of the ship or regiment to which
he belonged; and if they were the
writers of the letters, they had to be
countersigned by the officer commanding.
When this regulation was
not complied with letters were
charged as ordinary, and postmarked
with <i>Fig.</i> 47.</p>

<p>No doubt there are many more postmarks with a naval
interest, including those valued by collectors as indicating
stamps on letters originating in the various naval stations abroad
from 1858 to 1870, recognised by the following letters and
numbers:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>A79 to A89.    Pacific Naval Stations.</li>

  <li>A90 to A99.    Atlantic Naval Stations.</li>


  <li>B03, B12, B56. African Naval Stations.<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></li>

  <li>B53 (Mauritius), B62 and C79 (Hong Kong), B64 (Seychelles).</li>

  <li>Also "B", "H", and the date stamp in the case of "Ascension".</li>
</ul>

<p>In the present war the naval postmarks promise to be of
exceptional interest. The postmarks for both Army and Navy
give no clue to the locality in which the correspondence
originates; this, of course, applies to
mails coming from the field or area of
operations; there is no occasion to
disguise place of origin of letters going out
to sailors or soldiers. Most of the naval
marks at present in use bear no inscriptions
of any kind, though there is a type inscribed
Fleet Post Office (<i>Fig.</i> 48).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_2_1_INDIA" id="SEC_2_1_INDIA"></a>The Army Postal Service forms a highly organised
branch of the Indian Army organisation. It dates
from 1878-1880, when, during the Afghan War, a
mail cart route was set up between Peshawar and Jellalabad,
and a horse post was conducted thence to Kabul, in all about
176 miles. Jhelum and Peshawar were also connected by
rail, a military transport train being run by the Post Office
between these points. Even earlier than this date there were
postal arrangements for Indian Expeditionary Forces, including
that operating in Abyssinia (1867-68), the type of postmark
being lettered F.F. (Field Force), as in <i>Fig.</i> 58.</p>

<span class="caption">58</span>
</div>

<p>The postmarks used on letters despatched from troops accompanying
the numerous Indian military expeditions form a very
considerable range for philatelic exploration. They include
Egypt, Miranzi, Kurrum, Hazara, Waziristan, Suakim, Tochi,<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Chitral, Malakand, Tirah, China, Tibet, Somaliland, and South
Africa. The system of the Indian Army Postal Service is
similar to that already described for the British Expeditionary
Force on the Continent. A base office is established at each
military base, and works as a head office, communicating with
India and with the field. Field post offices of 1st and 2nd
class are attached to brigades, divisional troops, and divisional
headquarters, and these fly a distinguishing flag by day and
display a distinguishing lamp by night. The establishment of
base and field offices varies according to the size of the force
which they are to serve, but ordinarily the establishment of a
base office is: 1 postmaster, 2 deputy postmasters, 15 clerks, 2
khalassis, 6 packers, 1 sweeper. First class field post offices
are accompanied by 1 postmaster, 2 clerks, 1 packer, 2 tent
khalassis, and 1 sweeper, while for second class field post offices
the establishment consists only of a postmaster, a packer, and
a sweeper. In addition there are supervising officers for each
division, and in the event of the post office making its own
arrangements for transport between the base and the field offices,
a number of overseers are required. The officers and men all
have the word "<span class="smcap">POST</span>" in brass letters on the shoulders of their
uniforms.</p>

<p>Postage stamps of India (including postcards and embossed
envelopes, both ordinary and "official") are stocked by all
field post offices, and ordinarily a six-months' supply is sent
out with the force, and is distributed from the base office to
the field post offices. It is part of the duty of the base office
to see that each field office maintains a sufficient stock of stamps,
in accordance with a minimum determined by the chief superintendent
in respect of each field post office.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_2_2_CHINA" id="SEC_2_2_CHINA"></a>In 1900, in connection with the Boxer Troubles in China,
Indian troops were despatched to assist with contingents from
all the Powers in the relief of the Legations, and with them
went their Army Post Office. Since the settlement of the
troubles a permanent Legation Guard has been maintained by
the Indian Army in China. On reaching China, the Indian Army
Post Office established its base at Hong Kong, but this was
temporarily shifted to Wei-hai-wei on account of objections
raised by the Postmaster-General of the British colony of Hong
Kong. The new base did not prove satisfactory, however, and
ultimately Hong Kong became the permanent base, and the<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Army Post Office worked in harmonious co-operation with the
British Post Office and the Chinese Imperial Post. Field post
offices were set up at Pekin, Tientsin, Shanghai, Stonecutters'
Island, Wei-hai-wei, Tongshau, Matao, Ching-Wang-Tao,
Yangstun, Tongku, Sinho, Hanku, Shan-hai-Kwan, and many
other points, sometimes consisting of a couple of tents, but often
during this campaign in more substantial structures, and even
(according to Mr. Ashley C. Vernieux) in the Temple of
Heaven at Pekin.</p>

<p>With the troops sent to China in 1900 the Indian Post Office
started the supply of specially overprinted Indian stamps, so
that stamps bought in China could not be subject to speculation
and sale in India by reason of varying rates of exchange. The
Queen Victoria stamps then current, values from 3 pies to
1 rupee were overprinted with the initials C.E.F. (China Expeditionary
Force), and the successive issues of Indian stamps
have been similarly overprinted for the use of the troops still
maintained in China (<i>Figs.</i> 59-61.).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_2_3_RAILWAY" id="SEC_2_3_RAILWAY"></a>On the suppression of the Boxer rising the troops of the
Allies were in occupation of Chihli, and the Pekin Shanhaikwan
railway was divided up between the English, Japanese, Germans
and Russians. By February, 1901, the administration of the
whole of the line was in the hands of the British, but it was
under the control of a Board consisting of a British director and
two deputies, one German and the other Japanese.</p>

<p>At this period the Allies had about 100,000 men in Chihli,
but the British troops were stationed at various stations on the
line. To facilitate the prompt delivery of the letters of these
British troops, the postal superintendent of the British force
applied for a sorting van to be attached to the train so that
letters could be dealt with <i>en route</i>.... To this application the
reply was that no concession could be given to the British which<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was not given to all the other forces, and that as the service
was then restricted to one train a day, such a concession might
result in the train consisting largely of mail vans. But to meet
the general convenience, subject to the British postal authorities
undertaking to receive and deliver the letters of all nationalities
posted at the stations or in a box attached to the van, thus<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
making the service international, a van was placed at their
disposal from April 20, 1901. The new facilities were announced
in the circular, of which a facsimile is given (<i>Fig.</i> 68),
and the extra fee was collected by surcharging and selling a
number of &frac12; cent Chinese stamps "B.R.A. 5 Five Cents"
in black or green (<a href="#FIG_69"><i>Fig.</i> 69</a>). The B.R.A. stands for British
Railway Administration.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;In order to allow of letters being posted up to the latest possible time, it has been
arranged, with effect from the 20th April, 1901, to open post offices at the Railway
Stations at Peking, Tientsin, Tongku, Tongshan and Shanhaikwan. These
offices will open an hour before the advertised time of departure of the trains
carrying the mails and will close ten minutes before the trains leave.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Only ordinary letters will be accepted at these post offices. Registered or
insured letters cannot be accepted, nor can newspapers or parcels.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The letters should in all cases have affixed to them the same stamps, or be franked
in the same manner, as if they were going through the post in the ordinary way.
The Railway Postmaster will therefore accept letters stamped with the stamps of
any nationality with post offices now in Northern China, and the stamp will
indicate the nationality of the post office to which the letter will have to be
handed over for delivery, or further transit, at the end of the railway portion of
the journey. Unpaid, underpaid, and unfranked letters will be accepted, but
they will he liable to all penalties now existing, and unpaid and unfranked
stamps will also run the risk of misdelivery.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The letters must be handed, <i>together with a fee of five cents for each letter</i>, to the
Railway Postmaster at any of the stations above named. This five cents is a late
letter fee and is in addition to the ordinary postage.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The Railway Postmaster will then affix the Railway stamp, and will retain the
letter for posting in the train. The Railway stamp will not be issued to the
public to affix themselves, nor will the Railway Postmaster accept any letters
with the Railway stamp already affixed.</p>

<p>The Indian forces in South Africa also had their own postal
establishment, with a special series of postmarks.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_2_6_IEF" id="SEC_2_6_IEF"></a>In the present campaign the Indian forces are accompanied
by fully-equipped field postal arrangements, and following up
the precedent of the China Expeditionary Force, the Indian
Expeditionary Force in Europe is furnished with a set of current
Indian postage stamps, cards, etc., overprinted I.E.F.
(<a href="#FIG_76_77_78"><i>Figs.</i> 76-85</a>). The Indian troops enjoy free postage on unregistered
letters and postcards posted to the United Kingdom,
France, and India, but correspondence to all other countries,
such as Switzerland, Holland, Scandinavia, and the rest of the
world has to be prepaid with I.E.F. stamps, as also the parcels
and registered letters for all countries.</p>

<p>The next figure (<a href="#FIG_85A">85<span class="smcap">a</span></a>) illustrates the type of base post office
mark used in France, and no doubt similar marks are being
used on these stamps supplied to the Indian forces engaged in
Egypt and elsewhere during the present war. <a href="#FIG_85B"><i>Fig.</i> 85<span class="smcap">b</span></a> although
not definitely identified is probably an Indian army postmark in
use in France.</p>

changes through which the country has passed during
the past forty years. <i>Fig.</i> 86 represents an early stamp of the
Republic, while the next figure (<i>Fig.</i> 87) is just one example
of several denoting the annexation of the country by the British
in 1877. There are several types of the "V.R. Transvaal"
overprint, as in <i>Figs.</i> 88-90.</p>

<p>A great blow to British prestige was struck in 1881, and the
result of the disaster of Majuba Hill was the establishment of
a Second Republic which in its turn overprinted the Queen
Victoria stamps with a Dutch inscription "Een Penny" (<i>Fig.</i>
92), subsequently returning to the original Arms design of South
African Republic stamps (<a href="#FIG_86"><i>Fig.</i> 86</a>).</p>

<p>Just before the outbreak of the last South African War in
1899 the ascendancy of President Kruger had led to the ambition
to see his features depicted upon the postage stamps of his
country, and a new stamp design (<a href="#FIG_91_92_93"><i>Fig.</i> 93</a>) was prepared for
this purpose, and a special paper was manufactured watermarked
Z.A.R. (Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek) as illustrated in <i>Fig.</i>
94. But the stamp was never issued, and the quantity of the
"Z.A.R." paper was sold and used for purposes very different
from that for which it was prepared. In 1900, after the late
Lord Roberts' march to Pretoria, the contemporary South African
Transvaal stamps came under British control again, and were
issued at first with the overprinted initials of Queen Victoria,
V.R.I. (<i>Fig.</i> 95), and later of King Edward, E.R.I. (<i>Fig.</i> 96).
These were superseded in due course by the London printed
issue of Transvaal stamps bearing the portrait of King Edward
(<i>Fig.</i> 97).<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="SEC_3_2_Orange_River_Colony" id="SEC_3_2_Orange_River_Colony"></a>Orange River Colony</span>. On March 17, 1900, Field
Marshal Lord Roberts issued the following</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>PROCLAMATION.</p>

<p>"Whereas it is deemed expedient and necessary for the welfare
of the Orange Free State that the Postal Service shall be resumed
in the aforesaid Republic as far as circumstances permit.</p>

<p>"I, Frederick Sleigh, Baron Roberts of Khandahar, K.G., G.C.B.,
G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., V.C., Field Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of

David George Amosi Falck Administrator of the Civil Posts in such
portions of the Orange Free State as have been or may hereafter
be occupied by British troops.</p>

<p>"And I do hereby order that the Postal and Telegraph Services
shall be resumed in the portions of the aforesaid Republic already
referred to, from the nineteenth day of March, 1900, under the existing
Laws and Conventions of the Orange Free State, subject to such
alterations as may from time to time be notified.</p>

<p>The stamps of the Orange Free State were successively overprinted
"V.R.I." and "E.R.I." (<i>Fig.</i> 98), and later on new
stamps were issued with the portrait of King Edward (<i>Fig.</i> 99).</p>

<p>Cape of Good Hope stamps were also used in the new Colony
with a special overprint reading "Orange River Colony" (<i>Fig.</i>
100).</p>

<p>A sixpence blue stamp of the Orange Free State (<a href="#FIG_98"><i>type of
Fig.</i> 98</a>) was in readiness for issue at Bloemfontein when
the British forces took over the control, and a few of these
escaped the "V.R.I." overprint. The stamp is familiar to
collectors with the overprint, and strictly speaking, without the
overprint it has no record of postal use.</p>

<p>A type-set label was issued by the Orange Free State early
in the war to indicate the franking of official correspondence
probably on military service. The stamp has a border of fancy
type ornament and simple type inscriptions in three lines "<span class="smcap">IN
DIENST</span>&mdash;R.D.M.&mdash;<span class="smcap">O.V.S.</span>"</p>

<p>The so-called "Commando Brief" stamp alleged to have
franked the correspondence of burghers on commando is a bogus
production.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="SEC_3_3_Krugersdorp" id="SEC_3_3_Krugersdorp"></a>Krugersdorp.</span> The South African Republic stamps alleged
to have been used in this Transvaal town with V.R.I <i>typewritten</i>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="SEC_3_4_Kuruman" id="SEC_3_4_Kuruman"></a>Kuruman.</span> During the siege of this town in British Bechuanaland
Cape of Good Hope stamps were overprinted "<span class="smcap">KURUMAN

philatelists as <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> issues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="SEC_3_5_Lydenburg" id="SEC_3_5_Lydenburg"></a>Lydenburg.</span> During the temporary occupation of this South
African Republic Town in September, 1900, the stamp commemorative
of penny postage (<i>Fig.</i> 101) was surcharged
"V.R.I. 1d." and the ordinary Transvaal stamps were locally
overprinted "V.R.I." (<i>Fig.</i> 102). The values are &frac12;d. green,<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
1d. carmine and green, 2d. brown, 2&frac12;d. blue, 3d. on 1d.

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="SEC_3_6_Mafeking" id="SEC_3_6_Mafeking"></a>Mafeking</span>. During the memorable siege of Mafeking, a
Bechuanaland town but under the Cape postal administration,
arrangements were made for a local post, and for occasional
transmission of letters to Cape Colony, Natal, Rhodesia, and
the United Kingdom. The postal arrangements of the town
had only been transferred to the Cape Colony shortly before
the siege, a fact which explains the variety of Bechuanaland
and Cape stamps available in the town during the siege. Payment
of postage at the special rates chargeable for the service
in the town and beyond was payable in the stamps of either
"British Bechuanaland," "Bechuanaland Protectorate," or of
the Cape overprinted "Mafeking&mdash;Besieged," and the new
value (<i>Figs.</i> 103-114). As will be noticed from the illustrations,
the Bechuanaland stamps were chiefly created by overprinting
the name "<span class="smcap">BRITISH BECHUANALAND</span>" or "<span class="smcap">BECHUANALAND
PROTECTORATE</span>" on English stamps.</p>

<p>The foregoing stamps were chiefly used for letters sent by
native runners who had to dodge through the enemy's lines
and get either to Buluwayo in the north or Kimberley in
the south. A special penny and a threepence stamp were
prepared by a photographic process in the town, and these
form the most interesting philatelic souvenirs of the South
African War. The penny stamp, designed by Dr. W. A.
Hayes, shows a portrait of Sergeant-Major Goodyear, of the
Cadet Corps (<i>Fig.</i> 115), and there are two sizes of threepence
stamp, designed by Captain Greener, the Chief Paymaster,
showing a portrait of the gallant defender of Mafeking, General
Baden Powell.</p>

the British troops occupied the town and district. The stamps,
which were but roughly printed in the office of <i>De Zoutpansberg
Wachter</i> in the town, are inscribed "POSTZEGEL" at top
"Z. AFR. REP." at each side, and
"1901" at foot. The value is
expressed in figures and word in the
rectangular opening of the frame of
printer's rule (<i>Fig.</i> 118). The
values issued were &frac12;d. green, 1d.
rose, 2d. orange, 4d. blue, 6d.
green, and 1s. yellow, and owing
to the crudity of the printing,
specialists find a very extensive range
of minor technical varieties amongst
this issue of six denominations.</p>

South African Republic stamps
with the <i>sans serif</i> initials V.R. in

<p><a name="SEC_4_1_MINISTER" id="SEC_4_1_MINISTER"></a>The postal arrangements of France have been deranged
oft-times within the past century by war and revolution.
It is just a century since the famous episode of the
Lavalettes occurred. The Count de Lavalette was Director
of Posts under Napoleon, and in 1814 he did his best to upset
the organisation and fled on the approach of the Allies. The
following year he returned to his post, and after Waterloo he
was arrested on a treason charge and sentenced to the guillotine.
The Countess made desperate efforts to gain the clemency of
Louis XVIII., but without avail. In the end she gained
permission to go to her husband in his prison. She went in a
sedan chair with her daughter, and an old servant of the family.
The gaoler left the couple to their last farewell, and on his
return saw the broken-hearted wife assisted out by her two
companions. A little later he approached the Count, who lay
collapsed upon his bed covered in a large cloak, and his face
buried in his hands. It was some time after ere the gaoler
discovered that his prisoner was the lady, and that the Count
had got clear away.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_2_REPUBLIC" id="SEC_4_2_REPUBLIC"></a>French stamps provide a very interesting record of the political
changes in the country, and provide one of the best illustrations
of how stamps demarcate the periods of a nation's history. We
have dealt at some length with this aspect of French stamps
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and limit our account here to a short pictorial
one. The first French stamps (<i>Fig.</i> 137) are inscribed <span class="smcap">REPUB.
FRANC.</span>, and followed in the wake of the revolution of 1848
when M. Etienne Arago was in charge of the post office. <a name="SEC_4_3_PRESIDENCY" id="SEC_4_3_PRESIDENCY"></a>They
were first issued January 1, 1849, after the election of Prince
Louis Napoleon to the Presidency. The head on the stamp<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
engraved by the elder Barre is not the head of Liberty, as is
commonly supposed, but that of Ceres, the Italian goddess of
Agriculture, who was the same as the Greek Demeter or
"Mother Earth," appropriate for the design of the stamps of
a country which is "one of Ceres' chiefest barns for corn."
Napoleon's <i>coup d'etat</i> of December, 1851, was followed by
the issue in 1852 of stamps in which his portrait takes the place
of Ceres (<i>Fig.</i> 138). <a name="SEC_4_4_EMPIRE" id="SEC_4_4_EMPIRE"></a>Late in the same year the Empire was
proclaimed, so in 1853 the abbreviated inscription <span class="smcap">REPUB.
FRANC.</span> was altered to <span class="smcap">EMPIRE FRANC.</span> (<i>Fig.</i> 139). Napoleon's
successes in Italy and elsewhere were acclaimed by adding the
victor's crown of laurel to the portrait on the stamps in 1863
(<a href="#FIG_140_141"><i>Fig.</i> 140</a>). <a name="SEC_4_5_EXPEDITIONS" id="SEC_4_5_EXPEDITIONS"></a>His various expeditions are marked for the collectors
in a most interesting range of Army postmarks, used in the
Crimea, China, Mexico, etc., and of French stamps used
in the French post offices in the Levant, similar to the British
ones described in chapter I., and now rendered obsolete by<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the closing of the post offices in October, 1914, as a result of
the "abolition of the capitulations." The Mexican expedition,
largely owing to the Civil War troubles in the States, led to
the placing of Emperor Maximilian on the throne of Mexico,
and to the issue of stamps of the Mexican Empire bearing that
ill-fated ruler's portrait (<a href="#FIG_140_141"><i>Fig.</i> 141</a>).</p>

series of stamps catalogued as Alsace and Lorraine (<a href="#FIG_233_234"><i>Fig.</i> 233</a>),
but more properly called the stamps of the German Army
of Occupation, as they were used in
the parts of France occupied by the
German Army during the war and
afterwards in the two annexed provinces
until superseded by the
German Imperial issues. September
2, 1870, witnessed the surrender
of Napoleon to the Prussians at
Sedan, and in November we find
the head of Ceres recur on the
stamps lithographed at Bordeaux
during the siege of Paris (<i>Fig.</i> 142).</p>

<p>This period is undoubtedly the most interesting one in modern
postal history. There is a vast array of Army postmarks of
the war, special postcards issued by the auxiliary committee
of the Red Cross at Strasburg, letters sent from Metz during
the siege by free balloons, and letters sent by a variety of ingenious
methods from Paris. M. Steenackers was the Director
of Posts under the republic proclaimed September 4, 1870,
and his endeavours to maintain postal communications between
Paris and the outer world are among the most fascinating of
postal records. A cable was laid under the Seine to Rouen,
but the Germans dragged the river and destroyed it. Telegraph
wire had to be smuggled into the country, as the Swiss Government
declared it to be contraband. Letters were enclosed in
different forms of hollow spheres and thrown into the river;
the spheres were flanged so that they would rotate with the
current. Hundreds of gallant messengers, ladies as well as
men, strove to reach the city with concealed messages, mostly
without success. One lady is said to have succeeded in getting
through with a letter which had been secreted in a hollow
tooth and the tooth stopped with gold. Even dogs were sent<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
with messages to Paris, but most of them were shot by the
enemy. <a name="SEC_4_7_BALLOON" id="SEC_4_7_BALLOON"></a>The chief means of sending letters out of Paris was the
balloon post, and almost the only messages received within the
city came by carrier pigeons. There were free balloons and
passenger balloons, a higher rate of postage being charged for
the latter. Letter sheets, etc., were issued for both services
inscribed "<span class="smcap">PAR BALLON NON-MONTE</span>," or <span class="smcap">PAR BALLON MONTE</span>.
A register was kept of the services of aeronauts during the siege.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_8_PIGEON" id="SEC_4_8_PIGEON"></a>The messages sent by pigeons were at first written in very
small handwriting, but afterwards they were photographed in
microscopical minuteness, so that a very large number could
be carried by one pigeon. These photomicrographs were projected
on to a screen by means of an optical lantern to read
and transcribe the messages when received in Paris. The films
were placed in tubes attached to the pigeon's tail. One pigeon
arriving in Paris January 28, 1871, delivered 40,400 messages
by this means.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_9_PEACE" id="SEC_4_9_PEACE"></a>The later and more peaceful history of France has been
typified on its stamps by M. Jules Sage's allegory (<i>Fig.</i> 143)
representing Peace clasping hands with Commerce across the
world by means of the post, and by the late M. Roty's
pleasing Semeuse or Sower design (<i>Fig.</i> 144).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_10_MILITARY" id="SEC_4_10_MILITARY"></a>By a law promulgated February 9, 1900, a long discussed
project to allow soldiers and sailors serving with the colours
a limited free postage was brought into operation. Each man
coming under the description was allowed to send two letters
a month free, and by another law of December 29, 1900, the
<i>Franchise Militaire</i> stamp system was introduced. These were<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at first the then current 15 centimes stamps with the overprint
F.M. (<i>Fig.</i> 145); their distribution is in the hands of the
military authorities, who allow two stamps a month to each
private or non-commissioned officer in the Army and Navy,
enabling them to send two letters not exceeding 20gr. free of
postage. The two types of the 15 centimes "Rights of Man"
issue exist with the F.M. overprint, issued in 1901 and 1903
respectively (<i>Figs.</i> 145, 146), and the succeeding Sower type
(<i>Fig.</i> 147) appeared in 1904. When the French inland postage
rate was reduced from 15 centimes to 10 centimes, April 16,
1906, the 10 centimes stamps were overprinted F.M. instead
of the 15 centimes, two of the Sower types of 10 centimes value
receiving the overprint F.M. respectively in 1906 and 1907
(<a href="#FIG_148_149"><i>Figs.</i> 148, 149</a>). Since January 30, 1912, these stamps have
been used on the official correspondence of the French civil
service as well as by the military.</p>

decree:</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_12_RED_CROSS" id="SEC_4_12_RED_CROSS"></a>As indicated in the decree, the first
stamp (<i>Fig.</i> 150) was only of provisional
character, the ordinary French
10 centimes stamp being surcharged
"+ 5c", and selling for 15 centimes,
two-thirds representing the postage, and
one-third the Red Cross contribution.
This was issued on August 18, 1914,
and in all 600,000 were printed before
the definite Red Cross stamp (<i>Fig.</i> 151)
was issued on September 10. The Principality of Monaco
has also issued a similarly overprinted stamp for the French
Red Cross (<i>Fig.</i> 152), and yet another of this class of
stamp has been issued for the French Protectorate in Morocco
(<i>Fig.</i> 153).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_4_13_POSTCARDS" id="SEC_4_13_POSTCARDS"></a>Special postcards have been furnished to the French troops
and there is a special postcard for the use of the public in
writing to soldiers. They are decorated with the flags of the
Allies in colours, and the first kind, "Mod&egrave;le A," bear instructions
to the effect that "This card must be handed to
the Quartermaster. It must bear no indication of the place<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of sending nor any information relating to military operations,
past or future. Otherwise it will not be forwarded."</p>

<p>On "Mod&egrave;le B" (<i>Fig.</i> 154), for the use of the public, it
is stated that "if it is to be forwarded immediately the card
shall contain <i>personal news</i> only." Messrs. Alfred Smith &amp;
Sons report the existence of an unofficial imitation of "Mod&egrave;le
B" sold in the streets of Paris. It differs from the genuine
variety in the following details:</p>

<ul><li>(i) The flags are misplaced so that the French flag leans over
to the right, instead of being vertical;</li>

<li>(ii) The red and blue colours are shaded with black lines
only, instead of white and black lines;</li>

<li>(iii) The ruled line at the back is plain, instead of being
composed of square dots.</li></ul>

<p>There is also a variety of plain letterpress cards, headed
"<span class="smcap">CORRESPONDANCE MILITAIRE&mdash;REPUBLIQUE FRANCAISE&mdash;CARTE
POSTALE</span>", and other textual inscriptions, or in some cases with
only the first two words, with an arrangement of space for the
address.</p>

<p>Many military postmarks have already been noted by collectors
in connection with the present campaign, but it is too
early yet to arrange them with proper regard to their use and
significance. One interesting episode is marked by the postmark
of the Central Military Postal administration
of Paris (<i>Figs.</i> 155, 156).
This establishment accompanied the
French Government when the latter
moved to Bordeaux on September 3,
and continued to use the postmark inscribed
Paris there, so that impressions
of <i>Fig.</i> 155 bearing dates between
September 3 and October 13 (the date
of the return to Paris) originated not
in Paris, but in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>A somewhat pathetic interest attaches to the mark <i>Fig.</i> 157
indicating "<span class="smcap">LIEU DE DESTINATION ENVAHI</span>" (place of destination

centre for civil correspondence undeliverable to parts of the
country which have been invaded (<i>Figs.</i> 158-160).</p>

with a few stamps of philanthropic interest in
connection with its wars. A set of four denominations
was issued in 1905 and sold at 3 kopecs per stamp in excess
of the face-value, this extra sum going to the fund organised
by the Imperial Women's Patriotic Union for the benefit of
orphans of soldiers and sailors who fell in the war with Japan.
The following are the descriptions of the stamps which were
printed by the Imperial Printing Office at St. Petersburg in
the delicate colour work for which that establishment is justly
celebrated; the figure in brackets denotes the price, in kopecs,
charged for each, including the 3 kopecs charity contribution
(<a href="#FIG_167_168_169"><i>Figs.</i> 167-170</a>):</p>

<p>The small doles of 3 kopecs per stamp collected in this manner
for the orphans' fund yielded about 50,000 roubles,
roughly &pound;5600.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_2_TZARS" id="SEC_5_2_TZARS"></a>The portraits of the Tsars never appeared on the stamps of
Russia until 1913, when a very fine portrait and view series of
stamps were issued (<a href="#FIG_171_172_173"><i>Figs.</i> 171-187</a>), and although not issued
as war stamps they are full of reminiscence of the three centuries
of the stirring history of the Romanofs.</p>

<p>The set begins with a picture of Peter the Great, after a
portrait by the Dutch painter De Moor, on the 1 kopec stamp.
There is another portrait of Peter on the 4 kopecs stamp, this
one being copied from an engraving of the picture painted by
Kneller to the order of King William III., and now at Hampton
Court. Czar Alexander II. figures on the green 2 kopecs
stamp, and Alexander III. is portrayed on the 3 kopecs. The
present Czar, Nicholas II., appears on the 7 kopecs brown, the
10 kopecs blue, and the highest value in the set, viz., the 5
roubles (1 rouble = 2s. 1&frac12;d.). A portrait of Catherine II.,
after the painter Skorodo&ntilde;mow, and another of Elizabeth II.
after Tchemesow, add two more to the list of illustrious females
in the stamp collectors' portrait gallery. These are on the 14
kopecs green and 50 kopecs brown, respectively. The other
Czars depicted are Nicholas I. (15 kopecs), Alexander I. (20
kopecs), Alexei Michaelovitch (25 kopecs), Paul I. (35 kopecs),
and last, but actually the first and founder of the dynasty,
Michael Feodorowitch (70 kopecs).</p>

<p>On three of the rouble values are views which include The
Kremlin at Moscow (1 rouble), the Winter Palace at St.
Petersburg (2 roubles), and the Romanof House (3 roubles).<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_3_1914" id="SEC_5_3_1914"></a>Early in the course of the present war the Russians invaded
East Prussia, and it is reported
that they were using
Russian stamps in that country,
but up to the time of
writing, examples have not
come to hand. The only
special marks yet noted in this
country from Russia are
various censor marks and
labels (<i>Fig.</i> 188).</p>

<p>In this war philatelic history is repeating itself, for Russia
has issued a new set of war charity postage stamps (<a href="#FIG_FRONTISPIECE"><i>Figs.</i> 189-192</a>)
for a fund organised by the Imperial Women's Patriotic
Union, of the face values 1 kopec, 3, 7 and 10 kopecs, each
of which sells for one kopec more than the franking value
denoted. The extra kopec goes to the fund, which is to relieve
distress among widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors killed
in the war (see <a href="#FIG_FRONTISPIECE"><i>Frontispiece</i></a>).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_4_JAPAN" id="SEC_5_4_JAPAN"></a><span class="smcap">Japan.</span> The rapid modern rise of our Far Eastern Ally to
power is marked upon a few interesting stamps of a commemorative
character. Japan's successful war against China (1894-95)
was commemorated by an issue of four stamps in 1896. These
are of two denominations, each of which is in two varieties,
an outcome of an Eastern etiquette which at a later date was
evinced in the stamps of the Republic of China. The Japanese
stamps in question portray two heroes of the war; the denominations
were 2 sen and 5 sen, but that there should be no
suggestion of any inequality in their admiration for the two
heroes, the Japanese postal authorities had two stamps of each<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
denomination prepared so that each warrior figured on a 2 sen
and also a 5 sen stamp. Thus neither could be regarded as
being valued higher than the other, and neither could be said
to be given greater prominence. One of the portraits (<i>Figs.</i>
193, 194) is that of the late Marshall, Prince Arisugawa
Taruhito, chief of the staff of the Army of the Japanese Empire,
and the other (<i>Figs.</i> 195, 196) is the late Lieutenant General
Prince Kitashirakawa, Commander of the Imperial Guards engaged
in the subjugation of Formosa.</p>

<span class="caption">195 &emsp; &emsp; 196</span>
</div>

<p>At a later date, 1901, there was a proposal to commemorate
the services of the late Lieutenant General, and a 3 sen stamp
was announced; its design was to comprise the imperial crest
(the chrysanthemum) and a Formosan Shinto Shrine. The stamps
were heralded as about to be issued in time for the festival
of the Shrine celebrated at Taipeh on October 27 and 28, 1901.</p>

<p>In 1905, as the outcome of Japanese military successes in the
East against China and Russia, full administrative control was
taken over Corea, and a special stamp of the value 3 sen was
issued to mark the amalgamation of the Japanese and Corean
postal services.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_5_JINGO" id="SEC_5_5_JINGO"></a>Yet another pair of stamps commemorates somewhat ancient
history; they were issued in 1908
and bear the portrait of the Empress
Jingo-K&ocirc;g&ocirc; (<i>Fig.</i> 197), who is stated
to have been Regent from 201 to
269 in lieu of her son Ojin. She
waged a victorious war against
Corea. The legend goes that the god
Sumiyoshi acting as pilot for her on
the sea, caused gigantic fishes to surround
the boat and keep it afloat
when a great storm threatened to send the ship to the bottom.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_6_REVIEWS" id="SEC_5_6_REVIEWS"></a>The next two stamps (<i>Figs.</i> 198, 199) were issued on April
30, 1906, to mark, according to the inscriptions the "Campaign
of the 37th and 38th years of Meiji. Memorial Postage
Stamp of the Triumphal Military Review&mdash;One Sen five Rin"
(or, for the higher value&mdash;Three Sen). In the centre is a
trophy of arms, including a field gun, rifles, and ammunition,
and the Imperial flag, the Crest or Chrysanthemum, within a
wreath of rice plant and pine. In the spandrels are the five-pointed
stars, badges worn by the Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>Two years later a great naval review was held at Kobe,
and although no special adhesive
stamp was issued, a quaint postmark
representing the bow of a
battleship was used (<i>Fig.</i> 200).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_7_KIAOCHOW" id="SEC_5_7_KIAOCHOW"></a>The stamps already mentioned
under Japan have only a commemorative
association with war.
In 1910 the 3 sen carmine stamp
then current was specially overprinted
with Japanese characters
(<i>Fig.</i> 201), signifying war or field
service. These were prepared for<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and issued to the Japanese military and naval forces in China
and Corea, and it is very probable that the Japanese forces
recently co-operating with the British at Kiaochow used stamps
of this kind, but with the overprint on the new 3 sen stamp
illustrated (<i>Fig.</i> 202).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_8_BELGIUM" id="SEC_5_8_BELGIUM"></a><span class="smcap">Belgium.</span> Brave little Belgium, whose King is the outstanding
hero of the present war has not hitherto had any
occasion to provide collectors with war stamps since the first
Belgian issue of adhesive postage stamps in 1849-50 with the
portrait of Leopold I. (<i>Figs.</i> 203, 204). But the German
invasion, and the gallant efforts to frustrate it, have left their
mark imperishably in the stamp album. <a name="SEC_5_9_ALBERT" id="SEC_5_9_ALBERT"></a>The last current
ordinary stamps of Belgium were in four designs by M. Ed.
Pellens, a professor at the Antwerp Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts,

<p><a name="SEC_5_10_MALINES" id="SEC_5_10_MALINES"></a>These stamps were manufactured at the Belgian State Stamp-printing
factory at Malines, and as the factory was destroyed in
the bombardment of the town late in August, it is unlikely that
more of these stamps will be printed. The Belgian authorities<!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
had been preparing a new issue of stamps before the war, and
had ordered machinery in England, which at the time of writing
is not delivered, but which will probably be delivered to the
Government at Havre, where temporary arrangements will be
made to supply Belgian stamps to the inhabitants of the small
part of the country not in the hands of the enemy, and incidentally
to be ready to reorganise the Belgian postal system
as the Germans get driven further and further back to their
own country.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_11_PRIVATE" id="SEC_5_11_PRIVATE"></a>Early in September, 1914, it was reported that a private postal
service was working between Ostend and Blankenberghe, and
Brussels, Namur and Nivelles at a charge of 1 franc per letter,
but no information is yet to hand of any special stamps or postmarks
being used in connection with the service.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_12_GERMANS" id="SEC_5_12_GERMANS"></a>The Germans have conducted the posts in Belgium with a
view to the requirements of their own countrymen in the temporarily
conquered land, and incidentally to make profit out
of the Belgians and out of philatelists. There will no doubt
be many interesting curiosities in the
postmark line arising from the Germanisation
of the names on the cancelling
cachets, such as Lowen
(Louvain), L&uuml;ttich (Li&egrave;ge), Kales
(Ostend), etc. But the chief philatelic
interest attaches to the issue of
special stamps, or rather the ordinary
German stamps, overprinted in Gothic
type "Belgien", and with the currency
surcharged in centimes (<i>Fig.</i>
209). Of these there are four<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
denominations, 3 centimes on 3 pfennig brown, 5 centimes on
5 pfennig green, 10 centimes on 10 pfennig red, and 25
centimes on 20 pfennig blue.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_13_RED_CROSS" id="SEC_5_13_RED_CROSS"></a>The Belgian Government authorised the preparation of stamps
for collecting funds for the Red Cross, and these made their
appearance on October 3, 1914. There are two sets of three
values&mdash;5, 10 and 20 centimes. The set in the smaller size
portrays King Albert (<i>Figs.</i> 210, 211), and the larger size
stamps bear a picture of a monument commemorating the Belgian
War of Independence, 1830 (<i>Figs.</i> 212, 213).</p>

<p>The Belgian Red Cross stamps were for some time rather
difficult to obtain, as it appears that the stock was left behind
at post offices to which the Belgian authorities have not had
access since their removal to Havre. Undoubtedly vast numbers
of these stamps could have been sold in England and elsewhere
had they been procurable from Belgian sources.<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_14_BOGUS" id="SEC_5_14_BOGUS"></a>The interest aroused in the Belgian Red Cross stamps, and
the difficulty in obtaining them, has probably been responsible
for the attempt to exploit collectors with a set of three labels
purporting to be "new Belgian stamps, sold in Flanders only
during two days. The emission was very small, only 15,000
series, which were paid the double of the nominal value, <i>i.e.</i>,
70 centimes." The "stamps" are figured 5 (green), 10
(red) and 25 (blue), but no "c" or centimes. They bear
within a fancy frame lettered BELGIQUE at top and BELGIE below
portraits of King Albert and his Consort (<i>Figs.</i> 214, 215).
Messrs. Alfred Smith &amp; Son submitted these "stamps" to
the Belgian postal administration, and were told that not only
are they not official stamps, but that "they have apparently
been obliterated with a stolen or forged date-stamp." The
"postmark" reads ROULERS&mdash;5 OCTO&mdash;18-19&mdash;1914.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_15_POSTMARKS" id="SEC_5_15_POSTMARKS"></a>The Belgian Government moved to Havre in France on
October 13, 1914, and there they have a special post office
using the postmark <a href="#FIG_216_217"><i>Fig.</i> 216</a>. The headquarters of the habitations
of the Belgian Government are reckoned part of Belgium,
and while the Belgians may send letters to their different addresses
in Havre or to Belgium, for the unit rate of 10 centimes (1d.),
letters for France, even for another part of Havre, are treated
as foreign letters, and require to be prepaid at the 25 centimes
(2&frac12;d.) rate.<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also Belgian military postcards at present in use

<p><a name="SEC_5_16_SERBIA" id="SEC_5_16_SERBIA"></a><span class="smcap">Serbia.</span> Revolutionary disturbances have assisted the changes
of the stamps of Serbia. Michael Obrenovich III., who figures
on the issue of 1866, was assassinated on June 10th, 1868, by
the friends of the abdicated prince, Alexander Karageorgevich.
Milan IV., his successor, had a troublous reign; during his
period the country was recognised as a kingdom with Milan as
king, but he abdicated in 1889 in favour of Alexander, his son.
The portraits of Milan and Alexander figure on the stamps of
their respective reigns, and in the case of Alexander we get one
of those philatelic issues which must imprint on our minds the
memory of notable or notorious events. It is within the memory
of most of our readers that Alexander and his consort, Queen
Draga, were assassinated by a number
of military officers in 1903, and the
house of Karageorgevich once again
ruled in Serbia in King Peter, the
present monarch. At the time of the
assassination a new series of stamps
bearing the portrait of Alexander was
in readiness for issue, but before they
were sent out under the new <i>regime</i>
the effigy of the murdered king was
almost completely obliterated by the
overprinting of a design of the Serbian
Arms (<i>Fig.</i> 222).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_17_DEATH_MASK" id="SEC_5_17_DEATH_MASK"></a>The year following the grimmest of all the royal tragedies
of Serbia the surviving dynasty commemorated its centenary,
and issued perhaps the most sensational stamp series known to
collectors. These will go down to posterity as the "Death
Mask" stamps, although the curiosity of artistry which led to
this designation probably owes more to the excited imagination<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of the Serbian and foreign public than to any gruesome intent on
the part of revolutionary artists.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_5_18_PETER" id="SEC_5_18_PETER"></a>The Coronation stamps of King Peter, issued September 21,
1904, are of large size, and in two designs, by G. Janovic.
M. Mouchon was the engraver, and the stamps were printed at
the French Government Stamp Printing Factory in Paris. The
names of the designer and engraver appear in microscopic letters
below the design of each stamp. The first design (<a href="#FIG_223_224"><i>Fig.</i> 223</a>)
shows a medal on which the profile of the new King Peter is
superimposed upon the profile of the founder of the dynasty
"Kara," or Black George. The names inscribed upon the
medal are KARA GJORGJE at left, and PETAR I. at right. To the
left and right of the medal respectively are the centennial dates
1804-1904, and below are the Serbian Arms, with the motto
SPES MIHI PRIMA DEUS. Along the top of the stamp in Sclavonic
characters is KRALJEVINA SRBIJA (Kingdom of Servia), the
value in PARA is in the lower left corner, and the word POSHTA
in the lower right corner. This design was used for all the
para values.</p>

<p>For the higher values in dinar (<a href="#FIG_223_224"><i>Fig.</i> 224</a>), the same frame
design is used, but for the medallion what may have been the
reverse of a Coronation medal is shown. This is reputed to
be an allegory representing the successes of the guerilla leader
Kara-George, founder of the dynasty against the Turks in 1804.
There is a minute inscription on the medallion below the picture
signifying THE DAWN OF LIBERTY, 1804.</p>

<p>These stamps were at first received by collectors with disdain
and some disgust; the memory of the tragedy of June 10th,
1903, was still too fresh to allow the world to join readily
in any jubilation over the centenary of a dynasty which had
been dragged from obscurity after many years, to occupy a
throne lately emptied by the foul hands of assassins. It is
even said that the early sales of the stamps were entirely disappointing.
But this was all changed from the moment rumours
of a cunning intrigue attached themselves to the issue.</p>

<p>It is probably&mdash;almost certainly&mdash;an accidental effect produced
by the drawing or engraving of the two heads, one over
the other, that they produce in more ways than one, other
composite "faces." By masking the lower part of the profile
of Kara George it is possible to distinguish a new face with
an ugly gashed brow; but the alleged "Death Mask" of<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Alexander is seen by turning the stamp upside down, and regarding
that portion of the inverted
profiles which may be marked off
in triangle fashion with the chins as
the base of the triangle. There is
certainly a curious and hideous effect,
but similar, if less ghastly, artistic
curiosities occur in numbers of
other stamps, and in many other
forms of pictorial representation,
and in the case of the Serbian
Coronation issue it is probably
pure accident. <i>Fig.</i> 225 represents
the current type of Serbian stamp, with a military portrait of
King Peter.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_6_1_GERMANY" id="SEC_6_1_GERMANY"></a><span class="smcap">Germany.</span> In postal arrangements for armies in the
field Germany has shown earlier organised war posts
than any of our Allies. As with the regular postal
systems on the Continent, their early history is bound up with
the records of the princely house of Thurn and Taxis, of which
house Count Roger set up in 1460 the first horse post between
the Tyrol and Italy. About 1535 Johann Baptista von Taxis
created the first field post offices operating with the armies of
the Emperor Charles V. against the Turks and in Italy. The
hereditary monopoly which the Thurn and Taxis family enjoyed
from the fifteenth century continued well into the nineteenth,
the last remnant of it being purchased from the family by
Prussia in 1867 for three million thalers.</p>

<p>The growth of Prussian dominion and the fusion of the
German States into one vast empire is well demonstrated in the
stamp album by the joint Austro-Prussian issues for the conquered
Danish duchies, by the disappearance of the States
from the list of separate stamp issuing countries, replaced at
first by stamps of the North German Confederation, and later
by stamps of the German Empire.</p>

<p>The stamp collection plainly shows the modern progress of
military Prussia to the lead in the Germanic countries. Collectors
have many interesting postal relics of the Austro-Prussian
War of 1866 in the form of Feldpost Brief, and the
Franco-Prussian War brought about the first special war stamps
issued by Germany for the use of their armies of occupation in
Alsace and Lorraine, and in the invaded parts of France (<a href="#FIG_233_234"><i>Fig.</i>
233</a>). Of this campaign there are also the "Feldpost Brief,"
and the then novel form of communication by postcard was
also adopted for military purposes in the "Feldpost correspondenz
karte." From the foundation of the Empire the stamps
show little change. Being a collection of sovereign states it
has never been regarded as appropriate for the Kaiser's portrait
to figure on the stamps as King George's does on most of the
stamps of the British Empire. The German stamps to-day bear
a female head (<a href="#FIG_233_234"><i>Fig.</i> 234</a>) drawn by Paul Waldroff after a representation<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of "Germania" by an actress Fr&auml;ulein Anna
F&uuml;hring, which so impressed the Kaiser that he adopted this
as the symbol of Germany on its stamps. On modern high
value German stamps there are pictures of more war-like interest.
The 2 marks stamp shows an allegory of the Union of North
and South Germany from a painting by Anton von Werner,
with the motto "SEID EINIG, SEID EINIG" (be united, be
united!); the 3 marks (<a href="#FIG_235_236"><i>Fig.</i> 235</a>) shows a group of German
princes with the Kaiser on horseback at their head, a scene
drawn by W. Pape of the unveiling of the memorial to Kaiser
Wilhelm I. The highest German stamp denomination, the 5
marks (<a href="#FIG_235_236"><i>Fig.</i> 236</a>) shows another group, with the present Kaiser
prominent in it. This is also by Pape, and represents one of
those spectacular appearances which the Kaiser has revelled in,
the delivery of an address on the anniversary of the reconstitution
of the German Empire. The motto "EIN REICH, EIN VOLK,
EIN GOTT" (one kingdom, one people, one God) is one which,
as we now know, may be carried too far!</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the present war the German armies
have no doubt provided a great deal of new material for philatelic
study, and a recent number of a stamp journal published
in the Fatherland tells us that collectors there are zealously<!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
following the development of the German Field Post Offices,
adding the following information:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is a lot of interesting material already, not only with regard
to the printed forms used in the Field Mail Service, but also with
regard to the Field Post cancellations, Troop Letter cancellations,
and Censor postmarks. The correspondence coming from the garrisons
very rarely bear a Field Post cancellation, and it is generally
cancelled with ordinary town postmarks like the mails of troops still
at home. Besides this, there is, occasionally, a censor Troop cancellation;
to the latter also belong the Lazarett cancellation (hospital
service), of which we have seen several that were interesting. Lately,
a large number of pieces of mail have been coming from troops in
the enemies' country, without postal cancellations&mdash;owing to strategic
reasons&mdash;which is much to be regretted from the view-point of the
collector. In the near future, the working out of German Field
Post cancellations of the war of 1914 will be an exceptionally thankful
philatelic report. We will only mention the news that France
had issued several occupation stamps which were said to have been
used during the occupation of Muelhausen. A collector in Muelhausen
wrote to us about this mythological issue of stamps, that the
French, during both occupations, have neither used their own stamps,
nor have they organised any kind of postal service.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>Belgium, as already noted in Chapter V., has been provided
with stamps of the Germania type overprinted "Belgien" and
the value in centimes (<a href="#FIG_209"><i>Fig.</i> 209</a>). These have, no doubt, been
issued in enormous quantities with the hope of raking in shekels
not only from the Belgians and from German stamp collectors,
but also from collectors and curiosity hunters in neutral countries.
Although there are plenty to be had in Switzerland, Holland,
and other neutral countries at about sixpence the set of four, it
is extraordinary to relate that in one or two isolated cases
British dealers have obtained and sold supplies at very fancy
prices. As in the case of the similar issue so called "Alsace
and Lorraine" of 1870-1871, there will be plenty to go round,
and it will be time enough when the Huns have ceased from
troubling us to gather these relics into our albums as memorials
of Germany's trail through the beautiful towns of Belgium.
In any case it is inadvisable to buy any unused stamps originating
in an enemy country since the outbreak of the war, as they
represent a clear contribution to the enemy's Treasury.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Incidentally the German journal, <i>Berliner
Briefmarken-Zeitung</i>, in a

German collectors are buying up Belgian, Serbian, and Montenegrin

non-existent."<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p></div>

they were re-issued for the celebration of his
eightieth birthday (1910). The illustrations (<i>Figs.</i> 241-257)

<p><a name="SEC_6_5_TURKEY" id="SEC_6_5_TURKEY"></a><span class="smcap">Turkey.</span> The coming of the Young Turk has completely
changed the aspect of Turkish stamps. They have robbed the
collector of a rare illusion, and we owe them a grudge for it.
The picturesque fancies which we treasure in our memories as
the children store up the fables of the nursery, are dear to us
children of a larger growth. But our love of fantastic lore
suffers many a shock. Ever since the first stamps of the Sublime
Empire appeared in the reign of Abdul Aziz, on whom be
Peace, we collectors of stamps (on whom there can be no
Peace, for in stamps there is constancy but in change) have<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
nourished a fond fancy that pictures and portraits are forbidden
to the Muslim, and that Allah, who is great, and his prophet,
Muhammed, have set the Curse upon such works of Satan.</p>

<p>Much has been written by philatelists, as well as by
Muhammedan scholars, upon the subject, and the continued
philatelic fidelity to the <i>Thoughra</i> (the Sultan's sign manual)
on the Turkish stamps has ingrained into collectors the belief
that the Turks would never depart from their reading of the
law as set forth by Muhammed in this particular. The verse
which, in the Koran, sets forth the alleged prohibition is
transcribed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>O believers! surely wine and games of chance, and statues, and
the divining arrows are an abomination of Satan's work! Avoid
them that ye may prosper.</p></div>

<p>The wise men of the East, who have drunk deep of the
streams of wisdom that flow from the Book of Warnings, have
read many different meanings into the verse, and in Turkey it
has been taken to imply the forbidding of all figures, and even
the ruminative game of chess is barred by the strict Muslim.
We, of Christian faith, would appear to have a more emphatic<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
prohibition of the making of pictures in the translation of the
Mosaic law:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And God spake all these words, saying, Thou shalt not make
unto thee any graven image, or the likeness of anything that is in
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
under the earth.</p></div>

<p>Our theologians have not regarded the second Commandment
as a condemnation of the making of pictures, though many an
earnest believer, during the phases of pictorial frenzy through
which we have passed and are still passing, may have regarded
the picture paper and the picture palace as abominations of
Satan's work.</p>

<p>The new pictorial stamps of Turkey have dispelled one of
the mellow myths of our cult, a myth which, perhaps, was
simply an exaggeration of a prohibition which is more in common
with Western ideas than with Western practices. For instance,
there have been recorded seizures of pictorial postcards in Turkey,
attributed to the Muhammedan law; but these probably concerned
cards which gave offence to Muslim susceptibilities by
their blatant portrayal of the unveiled faces (<i>inter alia</i>) of women.
If the prohibition of pictures in the past has been no myth, and
the late departure from precedent is the result of the advent of
the New Turk, then, indeed, the New Turk hath courage,
for each true believer of the Prophet must needs regard every
new-born child, whether a creature of the flesh or of the mind,
as a thing that is touched by Satan.</p>

<p>Yet one other illusion concerning Turkish stamps has been
shattered of recent years. We are told now that the Crescent,
so long an emblem of the Sublime Empire, owes nothing to the
moon. The barking of dogs on the appearance of the moon
at the siege of Byzantium may have saved the city, and the
partial eclipse of the orb of night may have aided the Turks at
the capture of Constantinople, but the Turkish Crescent is no
memorial thereof, merely a horse-shoe or an amulet. Professor
Ridgeway says it is the result of the base-to-base conjunction of
two claw or tusk amulets. Says another writer, "There is no
historical evidence that the Turks thought at all of the moon
when they adopted a crescent as their national symbol."</p>

<p>Turkey's first departure from the <i>Thoughra</i> device for its
stamps was in 1913, when a set of crude picture stamps displayed
an alleged view of the new General Post Office at
Constantinople (<i>Fig.</i> 280). Later in the same year a finely-engraved
set of three denominations, 10, 20, and 40 paras, was
issued to commemorate the recapture on July 22, 1913, of the
fortress of Adrianople after the Balkan War. The design,<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
which was engraved in London, shows a view of the Mosque
of Selim (<i>Fig.</i> 281).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<span class="caption">280 &emsp; &emsp; 281</span>
</div>

<p>On January 15, 1914, a fine new set of London-printed
stamps was issued depicting a number of scenes in the Turkish
Empire and a portrait of H.M. Sultan Muhammed V. Incidentally
some of the designs are of warlike interest, notably
the cruiser <i>Hamidieh</i> on the 2 piastres (<a href="#FIG_271_272"><i>Fig.</i> 272</a>), Turkish
War Office on the 5 piastres (<a href="#FIG_273_274"><i>Fig.</i> 274</a>), and the forts of the
Bosphorus on the 50 piastres (<a href="#FIG_277_278"><i>Fig.</i> 277</a>).</p>

<p>In addition there were issued four postage due stamps, one
bearing the warlike "Arms" of Turkey, and the other the
Thoughra, or sign-manual, of Sultan Muhammed V. (<i>Figs.</i>
282, 283).</p>

<p>Already the present war, even before Turkey had on its part
opened hostilities, has produced an important effect upon the
postal arrangements of Turkey by the "abolition of the
Capitulations" which took effect on October 1, 1914. The
various Powers interested in Turkey have for many years maintained
agencies of their own postal administrations in Constantinople
and other parts of the Turkish Empire, and these,
owing to the untrustworthiness of the Turkish service, secured
the bulk of the foreign correspondence both of Europeans and
Turks. Latterly, Turkey has been endeavouring to compete
more keenly with these rival post offices within its own
dominions, and they have sold specially earmarked stamps to
business firms for use on foreign correspondence at a substantial
discount off face value.</p>

<span class="caption">284 &emsp; &emsp; 285</span>

<p>The star overprinted in blue or red (<i>Figs.</i> 284, 285) on the
current stamps indicates those sold in this way.<!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of the foreign post offices in Turkey, including our own
British post office, used special stamps. Years ago, when the
British office was first set up, ordinary English stamps were sold,
but there were abuses of the currency values so that it was found
desirable to overprint our English stamps for use in Turkey with
either the value in Turkish currency, or with the word <span class="smcap">LEVANT</span>,
which effectually prevented any large purchases in Turkish
money being exchanged at the English face value.
The Turkish Government has long been trying to get these
foreign post offices closed, but without success until the outbreak
of the present war; they are all now closed, and their
stamps consequently obsolete. The nations having had special
stamps for their post offices in Turkey are:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Britain (closed October, 1914).</li>
<li>France (closed October, 1914).</li>
<li>Russia (closed October, 1914).</li>
<li>Italy (closed October, 1914).</li>
<li>Roumania (discontinued 1896).</li>
<li>Austria (closed October, 1914).</li>
<li>Germany (closed October, 1914).</li>

<p>A curious set of stamps, never
really required for postal duty,
was issued by the Turks during
the Graeco-Turkish War of 1898,
under the pretext of being required
for the use of the Turkish Army
of Occupation. The Turkish
inscription on these odd-shaped
stamps (<i>Fig.</i> 286) reads "Special
for Thessaly, that part of the
country conquered." Even at the
time these stamps first saw the
light in Thessaly, the Turks were boarding their transports to
evacuate the country. Large remainder stocks have been sold
since the evacuation, and extensive forging of these stamps has
been detected.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_7_1_USA" id="SEC_7_1_USA"></a><span class="smcap">United States.</span> In December, 1860, South Carolina in
convention repealed the act adopting the Constitution
of the United States, a move which was promptly
followed by other Southern States, and led to the American
Civil War. On February 18, 1861, a provisional Confederate
Government under Jefferson Davis was set up at Montgomery,
Alabama, with all the appendages of military and civil administration,
including a post office department. The Confederate
Government later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and throughout
the long and bloody war from 1861-1865 the Confederate
States maintained a separate postal service, with separate postage
stamps. Judge John H. Reagan was Postmaster-General.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_7_2_CIVIL_WAR" id="SEC_7_2_CIVIL_WAR"></a>The United States postage stamps current at the beginning
of the war were the beautiful series of 1851-60, and as large
quantities remained in stock at Southern post offices, these issues
were demonetized and replaced hurriedly by the now rare
<i>premi&egrave;re gravures</i> of August, 1861, which were promptly superseded
by the more finished designs of September, 1861.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_7_3_CONFEDERATE" id="SEC_7_3_CONFEDERATE"></a>The Confederate States stamps lack the excellence of engraving
and printing of the United States stamps, a deficiency
due to the difficult conditions under which they were produced
in the country or imported from England. But what they
lack in this respect is more than amply compensated by their
historic significance and associations. The home produced
stamps were prepared under the stress of invasion; the foreign
manufactured ones and much of the material for the local productions
had to be brought through the blockade. In the annals
of philately there are no more exciting records than those which
tell of the capture of a ship bearing three De La Rue plates
and 400,000 dollars worth of Confederate States stamps, which
the agent of Davis's Government managed to throw overboard,
or of the despatch (preparatory to the evacuation of Richmond)
of printing press, dies, plates, and stamps to Columbia, in South
Carolina, where they arrived only to be destroyed in the holocaust
following upon General Sherman's capture of the city.
The different designs of the successive issues of Confederate<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
stamps are shewn in <i>Figs.</i> 287-295; their history we have

<p>Some bogus stamps purporting to have been used in various
temporary services are illustrated (<a href="#FIG_294_295_296"><i>Figs.</i> 296-299</a>), including
one showing a fort at Charlestown, and another which purports
to prepay "blockade postage" to Europe.</p>

<p>The postmasters of a number of towns in the Confederate
States found it desirable pending the receipt of stamps from the
Confederate Government to prepare and issue provisional stamps
of their own to denote prepayment of postage. Among these
are some of the rarest postage stamps known to collectors;
the best authenticated issues emanated from:&mdash;</p>

in Louisiana; Beaumont, Goliad, Gonzales, Helena, Independence,
and Victoria in Texas; Bridgeville, Greenville, Grove Hill, Livingston,

<p><a name="SEC_7_4_SPAIN" id="SEC_7_4_SPAIN"></a>The war with Spain produced a considerable effect upon
stamp issues; but the war tax stamps which were very popular
with young collectors by reason of their bearing a picture of
the battleship <i>Maine</i> (<i>Figs.</i> 300, 301) were in no sense postage
stamps, though often affixed to letters as small contributions to
the war funds. Throughout the campaign there were many
United States military postal cancellations used in Cuba (<a href="#FIG_302"><i>Fig.</i>
302</a>), Porto Rico (<a href="#FIG_303"><i>Fig.</i> 303</a>), and the Philippines (<a href="#FIG_304"><i>Fig.</i> 304</a>),
and United States postage stamps were later overprinted for
these and other former Spanish colonies, <i>e.g.</i>, Cuba, Guam,
Philippine Islands and Porto Rico (<a href="#FIG_305_306_307"><i>Figs.</i> 305-307</a>). These
have since been replaced by definite issues for the Republic of
Cuba, and for the Philippines.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_7_6_CANADA" id="SEC_7_6_CANADA"></a><span class="smcap">Canada.</span> Our great North American dominion gave us a
patriotic Empire stamp a few years ago to mark the introduction
at Christmas 1898, of Imperial Penny Postage (<a href="#FIG_308_309"><i>Fig.</i> 308</a>). It
shows a map of the world on Mercator's projection with the
British possessions coloured in red, and with a line quoted from<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Sir Lewis Morris's jubilee ode, "We hold a vaster Empire
than has been." The "bumptiousness" of the quotation led
<i>Punch</i> to suggest a few alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are richer than anybody.</li>
<li>We are Tremendous Swells.</li>
<li>The Policeman outside Mansion House is the finest in the world.</li>
<li>Our fleet can smash all the rest.</li>
<li>Mind your eye!</li>
<li>By Jingo, if we do&mdash;!!!</li>
<li>Go to Jericho!</li>
</ul>

<p>The difficulties of printing a map of the world in colours within
the space of a postage stamp led to "minor" geographical
inexactitudes, such as the annexation by the red colour, of the
United States, the invasion of France by England, and the
removal of the Cape of Good Hope out into the sea. But
unlike the Dominican Republic's map stamp of 1900 it did not
lead to complications with other countries.</p>

<p>Canada's Quebec Tercentenary issue includes some stamps of
martial interest (<a href="#FIG_308_309"><i>Figs.</i> 309-311</a>), the 5 cents shows the French
Governor Champlain's house in Quebec, round which a wide
ditch was dug and breastworks were thrown up and cannon
mounted to protect the colonists from the savages. Generals
Wolfe and Montcalm are portrayed on the 7 cents, the 10 cents
shows the old city and fort of Quebec in 1700, and the other
denominations show incidents in the exploration of Canada and
portraits of King Edward and Queen Alexandra, and of King
George and Queen Mary.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_7_8_SOUTH" id="SEC_7_8_SOUTH"></a>Martial portraits figure on the stamps of many of the South
and Central States; to mention them all would require a goodly
sized dictionary of American biography. In addition, specialists
find much interest in tracing, by extra-territorial postmarks, the
movements of troops in the various wars between Brazil and
Paraguay, Chili and Peru, etc.; and many of the countries give
us scenes recording outstanding incidents in their histories, especially
on their issues commemorative of the centenary of their
freedom from the Spanish yoke. Chili, for example, depicts
the battles of Chacabuco, Roble, Maipo, the sea fight of April<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
27, 1818, between the <i>Lautaro</i> and the <i>Esmeralda</i>, and another
ending in the capture of the <i>Maria Isabella</i> on October 28.
In this series also is a portrait of the renowned Admiral Cochrane,
the 10th Earl of Dundonald, who organised the Chilian
Navy and played a great part in Chili's struggles for freedom
from Spain.</p>

<p>Ecuador's issue of 1896 marks the end of a period of civil
strife and the triumph of the Liberal Party, a portion of the
proceeds of the sale of the stamps being devoted to the destitute
families of soldiers killed while serving in defence of the
Liberal cause.</p>

<p>Colombia gives us a number of stamp designs of war-like
interest, including warrior heroes, and a crude picture (<i>Fig.</i>
318) of the cruiser <i>Cartagena</i>. A particularly bitter commemoration
of the centenary of the independence of Colombia in
1910 was the picturing on a registration fee stamp of the wholesale
executions ordered by the Spanish victors at Carthagena
on February 24, 1816. (<i>Fig.</i> 319). To this stamp objections
were raised by the Spanish Minister at Bogota, and in deference
to his protests it was withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>Guatemala displays its Artillery Barracks (<i>Fig.</i> 320). The
much disturbed Dominican Republic warns off possible invaders
by displaying the fortress of Santo Domingo. Its map issue
of 1900 (<i>Fig.</i> 320<span class="smcap">A</span>), owing to a dispute over the boundary
indicated
nearly led to war with the Haytian Republic. Hayti
shows the fortress of Sans Souci (<a href="#FIG_321"><i>Fig.</i> 321</a>). Peru having had
its stamps much overprinted by the Chilians in 1881-1883, vaunts
more peaceful subjects on its recent picture stamps, <i>e.g.</i>, its
General Post Office, Municipal Institute of Hygiene, and the
Lima Medical School. Uruguay, after its civil war of 1904,
added a "peace" overprint to its contemporary stamps, reading
<span class="smcap">PAZ</span>-1904. It also illustrates the fortress and port of Montevideo,<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and its cruiser of the same name on its issues of 1908
and 1909 (<a href="#FIG_322_323"><i>Fig.</i> 322</a>), and Venezuela has given us crude
sketches of the revolutionary steamer <i>Bankigh</i> (<a href="#FIG_322_323"><i>Fig.</i> 323</a>), and
a map stamp illustrative of the great boundary dispute with
Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_1_VICTORIA" id="SEC_8_1_VICTORIA"></a>Australasia has not had much occasion for war stamps,
but it is worthy of note that at the time of the South
African War Victoria issued two postage stamps of
patriotic designs, obtained in public competition. The Victoria
Cross design (<i>Fig.</i> 324) gained the prize for the penny stamps
and the prize for the twopence stamps was awarded for the
other design (<i>Fig.</i> 325) showing a picket on foot and armed
scouts scanning the horizon of the open veldt in the Transvaal,
whilst in the distance are the faint outlines of the hills which
the British have had to scale. The central figures in the latter
design are in the uniform of the Victorian contingent. These
stamps sold at 1s. and 2s. each although they only prepaid 1d.
and 2d. postage respectively, the balance going to the Patriotic
Fund.<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

capital of the Colony, Bridgetown, but its claim to be the first
erected to Nelson's memory is contested.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_5_BALKAN" id="SEC_8_5_BALKAN"></a>The recent Balkan Wars (1912-13)
would require a volume to describe in
detail the philatelic results. Two Greek
stamp designs commemorate the victories
of the troops allied against Turkey.
One shows the cross of Constantine
over the Acropolis and city of
Athens and the Bay of Salamis; the
other depicts the eagle of Zeus flying<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
over Mount Olympus with a snake in its talons. <i>Fig.</i> 329 shows
the design of two war charity stamps sold for the benefit of Greek
soldiers incapacitated in the campaign, and for the widows and
orphans of the killed. Greece overprinted stamps very lavishly for
territories occupied during the war. When the fleet occupied
Mytilene the Greek authorities overprinted the Turkish stamps they
found there with a Greek inscription rendered "Greek occupation&mdash;Mytilene."
Lemnos was furnished with Greek stamps overprinted
<span class="smcap">LEMNOS</span> in Greek characters, and many other places
were provided with Greek stamps overprinted with an inscription
signifying "Greek Administration." In Samos four issues
of new stamps appeared in 1912-1913, and Icaria's Independent
Government stamps prepared just prior to the Greek occupation
were overprinted "Greek Administration."</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_6_ALBANIA" id="SEC_8_6_ALBANIA"></a>Albania's separate stamp issues were an outcome of the
Balkan Wars. The first were created in 1913 by overprinting
Turkish stamps with a device of a double-headed eagle and the
word <span class="smcap">SHQIPENIE</span> (<i>Fig.</i> 330). Since then four or five new issues
have appeared, crude labels of circular handstamp pattern (<i>Fig.</i>
331) with the value typewritten. More recently a series has
appeared depicting Skanderbeg, the warrior hero of the
Albanians, and these were overprinted in March, 1914, with
an inscription "<i>7 Mars. 1467.</i> rroft&euml; mbreti. 1914" to commemorate<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the arrival of Prince William of Wied as Mpret.

<p><a name="SEC_8_7_EPIRUS" id="SEC_8_7_EPIRUS"></a>The "autonomous state of Epirus," another outcome of the
Balkan troubles, has given us some quaint stamps. The first
was the skull and cross-bones issue (<a href="#FIG_332"><i>Fig.</i> 332</a>), the inscriptions
on which read "Liberty or death&mdash;Defence of the fatherland&mdash;Lepta 10."
This was succeeded by a more ambitiously
designed stamp (<i>Fig.</i> 333) showing an evzone or light infantryman
in the act of firing. The simple name "Epirus" was
extended to "Autonomous Epirus" (<i>Fig.</i> 334). Other crude
issues have appeared in Epirote districts, as yet not very satisfactorily
authenticated. These include Koritza (<i>Fig.</i> 335) and
Moschopolis (<i>Fig.</i> 336), both places in lower Albania.</p>

<p>Crete's troubles may be ended with the final settlement of
the Turks; in its stamps since 1898 we see the influence of the
British, Russian and Greeks, and a remarkable range of revolutionary
stamps. On one modern stamp of 1907 (<i>Fig.</i> 338)
is depicted the landing of Prince George of Greece at Suda
on his appointment as High Commissioner. He is being received
by Admirals of various Powers, Noel of Great Britain, Skrydloff
of Russia, Pottier of France, and Bettolo of Italy. A
still more recent stamp of Crete shows the fort at Suda, and
was issued to celebrate the raising of the Greek flag on May 1,
1913.<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_8_BULGARIA" id="SEC_8_8_BULGARIA"></a>On two stamps of 1901 commemorative of the War of Independence
Bulgaria pictured a cherry wood cannon, a home-made
affair used by the Bulgarian patriots against the Turks,
and drawn from one which is preserved in the national museum
at Sofia (<i>Fig.</i> 339). The following year, 1902, the 25th
anniversary of the battle of Shipka Pass (August 21, 1877) was
the occasion for a set of stamps showing a view of the ravine
with the Bulgars tumbling rocks down upon their enemies (<i>Fig.</i>
340). Later stamps of this country show some interesting
portraits of King Ferdinand (<i>Figs.</i> 341-343) in naval and
military uniforms, and one showing the King with the sceptre
in his right hand and the orb in his left, and wearing the garb
of the ancient Tsars of Bulgaria. These form part of a fine
pictorial issue of 1911, and it is noteworthy that these stamps
may be found with Turkish cancellations, used by the victorious
Bulgars in the recent campaign before they could substitute<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Bulgarian postmarks for those left behind by the Turks. In
1913 the pictorial set up to the 25 stotinki, was issued with
an overprint in Sclavonic characters signifying "War of
Liberty" to mark the successes against the Turks.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_9_ROUMANIA" id="SEC_8_9_ROUMANIA"></a>The enlightened Prince Cuza was responsible for the introduction
of many reforms in Roumania, among them being
postal reform, with the use of adhesive stamps, those of 1865
bearing his portrait. He was obliged to abdicate the year
following the issue of the stamps as a result of a conspiracy.
The late King Charles was his successor, there being no
further developments to recall. Rather in this case we read
from our stamps the more peaceful story of the growth of the
King's beard. In commemorating the 40th year of King
Charles' reign a long pictorial series of stamps showed among
other pictures Prince Charles saluting the first shot fired at the
Battle of Calafat, the meeting of Prince Charles and Osman
Pasha in 1878, the Roumanian Army crossing the Danube in
1877, the triumphant entry of the victorious army into Bucharest,
and Prince Charles riding at the head of his Army in 1877.</p>

of the overprinted Italian stamps of Tripoli (<i>Figs.</i> 346-348).
From the Italian pages of our albums much of the story of
the makings of United Italy may be
learnt chiefly by the absorption into
one of all the separate stamp issuing
states, Sardinia, Naples, Sicily,
Parma, Modena, Romagna, Tuscany,
and, although much later, the
States of the Church. The jubilee
of the Union was commemorated by
a set of four fine designs in 1911,
one by Signor A. Sezanne showing
(<a href="#FIG_349"><i>Fig.</i> 349</a>) a sword grasped by
a hand, symbolical of the Italian
Union, and at the sides are branches
of palm in memory of the warriors
who died in the Wars of Independence.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_11_PORTUGAL" id="SEC_8_11_PORTUGAL"></a>Portugal does not offer much war-interest, though plenty of
historical associations, in its postage stamps. The Republic
followed so soon after the assassination of King Carlos that
the stamps with the portrait of the young King Manuel had no
long service without a distinguishing mark to show that the
stamps were issued by the Republican Government (<a href="#FIG_350_351"><i>Fig.</i> 350</a>).
These have since given place to a distinctive Republican design
(<a href="#FIG_350_351"><i>Fig.</i> 351</a>). It is interesting to note that the Red Cross
Society and the Civilian Rifle Corps in Portugal have a limited
privilege of free postage, for which they use their own special
stamps (<a href="#FIG_352_353"><i>Figs.</i> 352, 353</a>).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_12_SPAIN" id="SEC_8_12_SPAIN"></a>The postage stamps of Spain introduce us to the revolutionary
element in 1868 in which year Isabella II. fled to France as
a result of the revolution under Prim and Serrano. That was
in September, and the current stamps were overprinted before
the end of the year with the words <span class="smcap">HABILITADO POR LA NACION</span>
(authorised by the nation), signifying that they were now being
used under the Provisional Revolutionary Assembly. One of
the forms of overprint reads <span class="smcap">HALILITADO POR LA JUNTA REVOLUCIONARIA</span>.
Some of the known overprints did not emanate from
the headquarters of the Provisional Government but were added
at the order of local juntas or revolutionary councils. The
familiar emblematic figure of Spain followed on the stamps
issued on January 1, 1870.</p>

<p>The republican form of government did not last long, and in
1870 the Duke of Aosta, second son of King Victor Emmanuel
of Italy, was chosen King of Spain, now a limited monarchy,
as Amadeus I., and his portrait was introduced on the stamps<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of 1872-73. The tiny &frac14;c. de peseta stamps of the former
year bear a small design of a royal crown.</p>

<p>Changes at this period followed in rapid succession, and
Amadeus failing to make headway as a constitutional Sovereign
resigned his troublesome crown in February, 1873, in favour
of peaceful retirement in Italy. The little stamps aforementioned
were changed under the new government&mdash;this time
another form of republic&mdash;to shew a mural crown in lieu of
the royal one, and the portrait of Amadeus gave way to an
emblematic figure Peace in July, 1873. Peace! What most
desire, but few can obtain and keep. Nor was the next stamp
design of Justice (July, 1874) much less wide of the mark.</p>

<p>There were actually in Spain between the revolution of 1868
and the restoration of the house of Bourbon three different types
of republic, the limited monarchy under Amadeus, and a military
dictatorship. In 1872, too, the
pretender Carlos proclaimed himself
King of Spain, and issued the celebrated
Carlist stamps from 1873 to
1875. So far as the general issues
of Spanish stamps are concerned,
their changes subsequent to the restoration
of Alphonso XII., son of
Isabella II., are free from further
revolutionary changes, but there are
postal war tax stamps of 1874-1879,
and 1898 (<i>Fig.</i> 354).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_13_MELILLA" id="SEC_8_13_MELILLA"></a>A remarkable instance of planting a bogus set of stamps on
collectors occurred in connection with the Melilla campaign in
1893-1894. In the set there are 53 or possibly 54 varieties,
each for a different detachment of the Spanish forces. The
inventor of the scheme apparently launched his venture by going
about amongst the troops, sailors, officers, etc., distributing
specimens of the stamps he had conceived in their behoof, and
consequently the appearance of some of the labels on letters
emanating from soldiers and others at the war gave colour to
the supposition that these gaudy labels had been provided by
a generous and otherwise unoccupied government at Madrid.</p>

<p>Of the fifty-three stamps, all <i>except</i> Nos. 1 and 2 are perforated.
Nos. 1 to 5 are in design of <a href="#FIG_355_356"><i>Figs.</i> 355, 356</a>, and
were supposed to have been for the use of the five Army Corps.<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The colours are (1) black frame, arms red and yellow; (2)
blue frame, arms red and yellow; (3) as No. 1 perforated;
(4) as No. 2 perforated; (5) black, red, and orange;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_8_14_CHINA" id="SEC_8_14_CHINA"></a>China's troubles during the Boxer rebellion were reflected
in the stamp album by the "C.E.F." stamps of India (see
Chapter II.) and by the use of the stamps of several of the
Powers co-operating in the defence of the Legations. The
revolution of 1912 made its mark in the overprinting of the
Imperial stamps with various republican overprints (<a href="#FIG_366_367"><i>Figs.</i> 366,
367</a>) and the revolution when completed was commemorated
by two sets of stamps issued in November 1912; one set
bears the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat Sen in a frame in which are
unripe ears of wheat, and inscribed "in commemoration of the
<i>revolution</i>" (<a href="#FIG_368_369"><i>Fig.</i> 368</a>); the second set bears the portrait of
President Yuan Shi Kai, and in this set the ears of wheat are
ripe, and the inscription reads "in commemoration of the <i>republic</i>"
(<a href="#FIG_368_369"><i>Fig.</i> 369</a>).</p>

<p>Although not issued in connection with warfare, it may be
noted that the only separate postage stamps of Heligoland
appeared while the island was in British possession (<i>Fig.</i> 369<span class="smcap">A</span>).
Since its cession to Germany in 1890 the islanders have used
German stamps.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">The Great War of 1914-1915. Check-List of New
Stamps</span>.</p></div>

<p>At New Year, 1915 it is too early to show more than
a few of the first philatelic signs of the great world
war which is being waged between</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Britain,</li>
<li>France,</li>
<li>Russia,</li>
<li>Japan,</li>
<li>Belgium,</li>
<li>Serbia,</li>
<li>Montenegro,</li>
<li>Germany,</li>
<li>Austria-Hungary,</li>
<li>Turkey.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the developments are already full of significance, and
the stamps of each of the countries at war acquire a new interest
in the occasions for their extra-territorial use as the armies invade
the territories of their opponents. At the beginning of August
the Germans invaded France and Belgium, accompanied, or
followed shortly, by field postal organisations, of which few
particulars are yet available. By the middle of August the
French had entered Alsace and German Lorraine, and the
Russians having invaded East Prussia set up posts there in
which they used the current Russian stamps. The British
Expeditionary Force, with its well-equipped Army Postal Service,
was in France by the 16th. About this period the
Germans invaded Cape Colony. The Tsar's promise of autonomy
to Poland may ultimately demonstrate its fulfilment in the issue
of new stamps for Poland. France issued its first Red Cross
stamp, and similar war charity stamps have since appeared in
Monaco, French Morocco, Russia, Austria, Hungary, and
Bosnia. Japan's declaration of war, and successful attack on
Kiaochow, probably led to the use of Japanese soldiers' stamps
(<a href="#FIG_201_202"><i>Figs.</i> 201, 202</a>) by the forces engaged, possibly along with
Indian stamps overprinted C.E.F. (China Expeditionary Force,
<a href="#FIG_59_60_61"><i>Fig.</i> 61</a>), for the use of the co-operating British land forces. On
the 26th the British along with the French took Togoland, and
have already issued stamps of the Anglo-French occupation of
that former German colony (<a href="#FIG_384_385_386"><i>Figs.</i> 384-386</a>). Prior to their issue
the British Gold Coast stamps were used in Togo for a time (<a href="#FIG_370"><i>Fig.</i>
370</a>). Towards the end of the month the bombardment of<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Malines destroyed the Belgian State Stamp-printing works, rendering
it necessary to create an entirely new series of Belgian
stamps when the Government finds itself in a position to do so.
On the 29th Samoa was taken by the New Zealand forces, and
English stamps have been used there (<a href="#FIG_371"><i>Fig.</i> 371</a>), and already
a provisional and a definitive set of British Samoa stamps have
appeared (<a href="#FIG_382_383"><i>Figs.</i> 382, 383</a>).</p>

<p><!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>German attacks in September on various British and French
colonial possessions may in some cases leave philatelic records,
chiefly in the way of war postmarks which may be looked for
from the affairs in Nyasaland, British East Africa, Zanzibar,
German South-West Africa, etc. Postmarks, too, record the
withdrawal of the French Government to Bordeaux (<i>Figs.</i> <a href="#FIG_155">155</a>,
<a href="#FIG_156">156</a>), and the sending of great loyal contingents from Canada
(<a href="#FIG_372_373"><i>Fig.</i> 372</a>) Australia, and New Zealand (<a href="#FIG_372_373"><i>Fig.</i> 373</a>). The effect
on stamp issues caused by Turkey's abolition of the capitulations
has already been referred to as rendering a considerable number
of stamp issues obsolete, and this event has been commemorated
on the Turkish issue, which, by the way, was printed in London.
Australia's capture of German New Guinea and the Bismarck
Archipelago, is already reported to have been followed by the
re-issue of the German colonial stamps of New Guinea (<a href="#FIG_370A_370B"><i>Figs.</i>
370<span class="smcap">A</span>, 370<span class="smcap">B</span></a>) with a British "G.R.I." overprint.</p>

<p>Some postal aspects of the retirement of the Belgian Government
to Havre in October (<a href="#FIG_216_217"><i>Fig.</i> 216</a>) and the issue of German
stamps for Belgium (<a href="#FIG_209"><i>Fig.</i> 209</a>) have already been referred to.<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Turkey's entry into the war in November may have the effect
of removing Turkey from the list of European stamp-issuing
States, and has already led to the long anticipated proclamation
of a British protectorate over Egypt, and the annexation of
Cyprus. The fall of Tsingtau renders obsolete the German
colonial type of stamp for Kiaochow, although there may have
been some interesting provisional issue here, and also possibly in
the Marshall and Marianne Islands.</p>

<p>All these and many more happenings of the past few months
will leave their traces in new stamps, or in new uses for stamps,
and when at last the enemy shall be vanquished and Peace
reigns once more, one of the most fascinating histories of the
great War will be that recorded in the pages of the stamp
album.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_APP_1_EGYPT" id="SEC_APP_1_EGYPT"></a><span class="smcap">Egypt.</span>&mdash;An event of the greatest interest to philatelists is the
termination of the suzerainty of Turkey over Egypt, and the
placing of the latter country under British protection. As a
British protectorate, Egypt will be transferred to the British
Empire division of the stamp catalogues, and a greatly increased interest
will be taken in the postage stamps of the land of the Pharaohs, with
the result that the earlier issues will rise appreciably in value. As
recently as January 8, 1914, a handsome new series of stamps was issued
in Egypt, on the anniversary day of the accession of the now deposed
Khedive, Abbas II. These were not of a commemorative character, but
were issued on the anniversary as a compliment to the then reigning
Khedive. They probably call for no change in the designs under the
new conditions, and as they are denominated in English the present
stamps may be continued in use. But they will
probably be changed in regard to the watermarked
paper on which they are printed, as
the watermarked device is that popularly
known as the "star and crescent" (<i>Fig.</i> 387),
although modern authorities appear to agree
that the Turkish symbol is not a crescent (<a href="#Page_87"><i>vide</i>
p. 87</a>). The new Egyptian flag, under Sultan
Hussein I., is red with <i>three</i> silver crescents
each enclosing a star, instead of the Turkish
flag with the single "crescent" and star.
Thus although a new form of watermark may
not be deemed necessary, a change to the
"multiple" (or as printers term it, the "all-over") watermark of similar
device would appropriately denote the new regime.</p>

<p>In view of the great future now opening up for British philatelists in
the study and collection of Egyptian stamps, the present writer has completed
a full illustrated history of these stamps for publication in the
"Melville Stamp Books series," published by Messrs. Stanley Gibbons,
Ltd., 391 Strand (<a href="#Page_2"><i>see</i> page 2</a>). This will be issued almost simultaneously
with the present volume.<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>An Egyptian stamp which might have been included in the body of
the present work is <i>Fig.</i> 398, a postage-due
stamp issued in 1898. At that time the Egyptian
postal regulations charged 3 milliemes for prepaid
letters but double that sum (6 milliemes)
for unpaid letters, from or to non-commissioned
officers and men of the Egyptian Army in garrison
on the frontier, as well as at Suakim and
Tokar; the same tariff was applicable to
soldiers taking part in the Expedition to the
Sudan. In consideration of the fact that such
soldiers would be most frequently in places
where they would be unable to get postage
stamps, the authorities decided that unpaid
letters sent by them should only be liable
to the single rate of 3 milliemes instead of the double rate of 6 milliemes.
But as there was no postage-due stamp of 3 milliemes to use in collecting
this sum, it was temporarily permitted to use a 2 millieme stamp, with
half of another 2 millieme stamp divided diagonally, until the surcharged
stamp (<i>Fig.</i> 398) 3 milliemes on 2 milliemes could be prepared and issued.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_APP_2_SUDAN" id="SEC_APP_2_SUDAN"></a><span class="smcap">Sudan.</span>&mdash;The first stamps of the Sudan were created by overprinting
Egyptian stamps in 1897 for use at the Camp Post Office at Wadi Haifa,
and at points south thereof, the overprint reading "<span class="smcap">SOUDAN</span>" and
repeated
in Arabic characters. The first stamps of special design, the
attractive "camel" issue, also have military associations, being designed
by Colonel Stanton of the Oxford Light Infantry, depicting a camel
rider, alleged to be a portrait of Slatin Pasha. The rider is carrying
mail, and is armed with a rifle and two spears (<a href="#FIG_399"><i>Fig.</i> 399</a>). These stamps
were overprinted for use of army officials either with the words
"<span class="smcap">OFFICIAL-ARMY</span>"
as in <a href="#FIG_400_401"><i>Fig.</i> 400</a>, or "Army Service" as in <a href="#FIG_400_401"><i>Fig.</i> 401</a>. Another
interesting Sudanese military stamp design was used for the military telegraph
service (<i>Fig.</i> 402).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_APP_3_MOROCCO" id="SEC_APP_3_MOROCCO"></a><span class="smcap">Morocco.</span>&mdash;Following upon the proclamation of Egypt as a British
Protectorate, it was announced that Great Britain
has recognised the French Protectorate in
Morocco and has adhered to the Franco-Moroccan
Treaty of March 30, 1912. The
French stamps for Morocco (<i>Fig.</i> 403) have now
been overprinted "<span class="smcap">PROTECTORAT-FRANCAIS</span>",
as may be seen by comparing this 10 centimes
value with the same denomination utilised for
Red Cross stamp purposes (<a href="#FIG_153"><i>Fig.</i> 153</a>). The
change in the status of Morocco may render
the British postal agencies there unnecessary, in
which case the series of British stamps overprinted
"<span class="smcap">MOROCCO AGENCIES</span>" (<a href="#FIG_404_405"><i>Figs.</i> 404, 405</a>)
may be rendered obsolete.</p>
